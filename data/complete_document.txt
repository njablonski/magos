AELDARI
ARMY RULE

The Aeldari live on the brink of extinction. As such, their Farseers have 
become adept at reading future events, seeing the many strands of fate 
ahead of their people and the consequences of following each one. Taken at 
the right time, a simple action can avoid calamitous outcomes, aiding the 
Aeldari in their continued struggle for survival.

STRANDS OF FATE
If your Army Faction is Aeldari, at the start of the 
battle, make a Strands of Fate roll by rolling twelve D6. 

If you wish, you can then re-roll all of these dice, but 
if you do, roll one less D6. You can continue re-rolling 
all of the dice in this manner, rolling one less D6 each 
time you do, until you are satisfied with the results 
rolled (or until you only have a single D6 remaining). 

When you are satisfied with the results rolled, those 
remaining dice become your Fate dice for the battle. 
These results cannot be changed or re-rolled further, 
unless a rule specifically states otherwise. Keep your 
Fate dice to one side – this is your Fate dice pool.

Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your 
army with the Strands of Fate ability, if you have one 
or more dice in your Fate dice pool, you can use one 
of those Fate dice. To do so, select one of those Fate 
dice to substitute that dice roll. The dice that is being 
substituted is not rolled; instead, the value of the 
selected Fate dice is used as if it had been rolled (this 
counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all 
rules purposes). Each Fate dice can only be used in 
this way once. After using a Fate dice, remove it from 
your Fate dice pool and roll all remaining dice that are 
part of that dice roll (if any). You can use Fate dice for 
any of the following types of dice roll:

 ■ Advance roll
 ■ Battle-shock test
 ■ Charge roll
 ■ Damage roll
 ■ Hit roll
 ■ Saving throw
 ■ Wound roll

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Aeldari, you can use this 
Battle Host Detachment rule.

UNPARALLELED FORESIGHT
When the Aeldari take to the battlefield, any who 
oppose them are left confounded by their grace, 
elegance and martial skill. Where lesser beings would 
falter, the Aeldari move with a surety of purpose that 
can only be perceived as preordained. 

Each time an Aeldari unit from your army is 
selected to shoot or fight, you can re-roll one Hit roll 
and you can re-roll one Wound roll when resolving 
those attacks.

CORSAIRS AND TRAVELLING PLAYERS
The Dark City is frequented by ruthless 
mercenaries and nomadic warriors from other 
strands of the ancient race. Troupes of Harlequins 
and piratical bands of Corsairs accompany 
many Drukhari raids, free from constrictive paths 
to pursue profits and fated agendas across 
the galaxy.

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can include 
Harlequins and Anhrathe units in your army, 
even though they do not have the Drukhari 
Faction keyword. The combined points value of 
Harlequins and/or Anhrathe units you can 
include in your army depends on the battle size, 
as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

No Harlequins or Anhrathe models included in 
your army in this way can be your Warlord, and 
they cannot be given Enhancements.

YNNARI
Yvraine is a divider as much as a unifier amongst 
the Aeldari race, drawing both hatred and 
admiration. To some once-allies she and her ideals 
have become an immovable rift, yet between 
some once-enemies her influence has sewn 
bonds of fellowship once thought impossible.

If your Army Faction is Aeldari and your Warlord 
is Yvraine, you can include Drukhari units in 
your army, even though they do not have the 
Aeldari Faction keyword. The combined points 
value of such units you can include in your army 
depends on the battle size, as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 1000 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 1500 pts

No Drukhari models included in your army in 
this way can be given Enhancements. You cannot 
include units with any of the following keywords 
in your army using these rules: Phoenix Lords; 
Anhrathe; Avatar of Khaine; Solitaire; 
Haemonculus Covens.

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Enhancements.
READER OF THE RUNES
THE PHOENIX GEM
Using their prescience to discern the enemy 
At the height of the War in Heaven, Isha drew down

the heat of a hundred stars into a glittering gem to 
save Asuryan. It is said that the Phoenix Gem is the

only surviving fragment of this ancient stone, and still 
retains the power to return life to the fallen.

Aeldari model only. The first time the bearer is 
destroyed, roll one D6: on a 2+, keep it to one side. At 
the end of the phase, set the bearer back up again, 
as close as possible to its previous position and not 
within Engagement Range of any enemy models, with 
its full wounds remaining.
THE WEEPING STONES
Carved from psychoactive rubies, these runic stones 
resemble the beads of blood that drip from the 
hand of Khaine. In battle, these stones rearrange 
themselves, revealing elements of the future.

Aeldari model only. Each time the bearer’s unit 
destroys an enemy unit, roll one D6 and add it to your 
Fate dice pool displaying the result you just rolled.

Aeldari Psyker model only. In your Command phase, 
you can select one dice in your Fate dice pool, re-roll 
it, then add it back to your Fate dice pool displaying 
the result you just rolled.
FATE’S MESSENGER
The strands of fate coil and twist around this warrior, 
the paths of destiny manipulated to keep them from 
harm so that they might strike back at their foes.

Aeldari model only. Once per turn, just after making 
a Hit roll, a Wound roll or a saving throw for a model 
in the bearer’s unit, you can treat the result as an 
unmodified roll of 6 instead.

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Stratagems.

1CP

1CP

FEIGNED RETREAT
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Aeldari are forever elusive, and their 
actions are unpredictable and deceptive. 
What appears to be a full retreat one 
moment is revealed as the prelude to a 
devastating attack the next.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Aeldari unit from your army makes a 
Fall Back move. 
TARGET: That Aeldari unit.
EFFECT: Your unit is eligible to shoot and 
declare a charge this turn even though it 
Fell Back.

MATCHLESS AGILITY
BATTLE HOST – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Grace in battle and merciless efficiency 
are prized virtues in craftworld armies. 
Like the shimmering blades of Khaine, 
the Asuryani carve through the ranks of 
their enemies.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your 
army that has not been selected to move 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, if your 
unit Advances, do not make an Advance 
roll for it. Instead, until the end of the 
phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic 
of models in your unit.

2CP

1CP

FIRE AND FADE
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Aeldari are masters of hit-and-run 
tactics, engaging a target with a flurry of 
shots before quickly manoeuvring into 
cover or out of sight.

WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move. It cannot embark within a 
Transport at the end of this move.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select an 
Aircraft unit or a unit within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units, and 
until the end of the turn, the unit you 
selected is not eligible to declare a charge.

BLADESTORM
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The well-trained Aeldari are able to lay 
down a hail of fire from their weapons, 
their superior reflexes allowing them to 
track even the most sudden movement 
and place every shot perfectly.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your 
army that has not been selected to shoot 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, on a Critical Wound, improve the 
Armour Penetration characteristic of that 
attack by 2.

AELDARI – BATTLE HOST
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Battle Host Detachment rule, you can use these Battle Host Stratagems.

PHANTASM
BATTLE HOST – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The Aeldari are masters of misdirection, 
and they employ holo-emitters and psychic 
phantasms to fool enemy scouts.

1CP

WHEN: End of your opponent’s 
Movement phase.

EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move of up to 7". It cannot embark within 
a Transport at the end of this move.

within Engagement Range of one or more 
enemy units, and until the end of the turn, 
you cannot target that unit with the Heroic 
Intervention Stratagem.

LIGHTNING-FAST REACTIONS
BATTLE HOST – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Aeldari can process battlefield 
events at baffling speed, making their 
physical reactions so fast that they are 
able to dodge attacks that would hit any 
other target.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Aeldari unit from your army 
(excluding Wraith Construct units) that 
was selected as the target of one or more 
of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Hit roll.

The prism cannon of this vehicle is the bane of heavy battle tanks. In 
its firing process, a laser is discharged into a massive crystal prism 
that amplifies the shot’s potency. The energy is released in one of two 
ways – either as thin lances of light to destroy the toughest vehicles, 
or as a dispersed pulse to slaughter swathes of infantry.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES
ARMY RULES

In battle, Space Marines swear mighty oaths to destroy the enemies of the Emperor and uphold the honour of 
their Chapter, and such vows are sacrosanct. When the Angels of Death strike, they do so with the precision of a 
surgeon and the force of a thunderbolt. Experience and strategic expertise help them to read the shifting shape 
of the battle with post-human speed and clarity, directing their wrath towards one priority target after another. 
Command assets are annihilated, leaving the enemy reeling leaderless. Heavy armour, potent artillery and the 
vaunted elites of the foe’s forces are laid waste with horrifying speed, until the Emperor’s Angels of Death stand 
victorious over a field of smouldering wreckage and bolt-riddled corpses, and honour is finally satisfied.

OATH OF MOMENT
If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, at the 
start of your Command phase, select one unit from 
your opponent’s army. Until the start of your next 
Command phase, each time a model from your army 
with this ability makes an attack that targets that 
enemy unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you can 
re-roll the Wound roll.

SPACE MARINE CHAPTERS
 ■  If an Adeptus Astartes unit has a second 

Faction keyword on its datasheet, that 
Faction keyword is the name of that unit’s 
Chapter. For example, Marneus Calgar 
has both the Adeptus Astartes and 
Ultramarines Faction keywords, and is 
therefore from the Ultramarines Chapter.
 ■  You cannot include units from more than 

one Chapter in your army. 

ADEPTUS ASTARTES – GLADIUS TASK FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use 
this Gladius Task Force Detachment rule.

COMBAT DOCTRINES
The Codex Astartes has proven its worth as a superb 
treatise on warfare over countless battlefields, and 
has remained so even after ten thousand years. Many 
Space Marines hold its wisdom in awe, and exemplify 
its teachings, employing a flexible set of combat 
doctrines to eliminate their enemy. Few opponents 
can withstand the fury of such an onslaught. 

At the start of your Command phase, you can 
select one of the Combat Doctrines listed below. 
Until the start of your next Command phase, that 
Combat Doctrine is active and its effects apply 
to all Adeptus Astartes units from your army 
with this ability. You can only select each Combat 
Doctrine once per battle.

DEVASTATOR DOCTRINE
The Codex Astartes explains in detail the strategic value 
of overwhelming firepower applied to key targets while 
advancing into position in order to eliminate threats and 
create tactical openings.

This unit is eligible to shoot in a turn in which it Advanced.

TACTICAL DOCTRINE
As the warring armies close upon one another and 
vicious fire-fights erupt, the Codex lays out strategies for 
swiftly seizing the initiative and combining versatility 
with firepower.

This unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn 
in which it Fell Back.

ASSAULT DOCTRINE
The Codex Astartes leaves no doubt that the killing blow 
in most engagements must be delivered with a decisive 
close-quarters strike. It presents plentiful tactical means 
to achieve this end.

This unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which 
it Advanced.

ADEPTUS ASTARTES – GLADIUS TASK FORCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Gladius Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Gladius Task Force Stratagems.

ONLY IN DEATH DOES DUTY END

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes, 
combined with their transhuman 
physiology, makes them unyielding foes 
to face.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

2CP

Imminent death does not prevent a Space 
Marine from enacting his final justice 
upon the enemies of the Imperium.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making its 
attacks, and is then removed from play.

HONOUR THE CHAPTER

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Every Chapter has forged its own tales of 
heroism, and none of its battle-brothers 
would see that noble record besmirched.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, melee 
weapons equipped by models in your unit 
have the [LANCE] ability. If your unit is 
under the effects of the Assault Doctrine, 
until the end of the phase, improve the 
Armour Penetration characteristic of such 
weapons by 1 as well.

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Space Marines know precisely when 
to give ground in order to leave their 
enemies floundering, before surging back 
into the fight and driving them from the 
field in disarray.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, 
just after an enemy unit ends a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes Infantry 
or Adeptus Astartes Mounted unit from 
your army that is within 9" of the enemy 
unit that just ended that move.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move of up to D6", or a Normal move of up 
to 6" instead if it is under the effects of the 
Tactical Doctrine.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select a unit 
that is within Engagement Range of one or 
more enemy units.

1CP

1CP

The tenets of the Codex Astartes allow for 
unorthodox use of combat tactics and 
the employment of divergent strategic 
doctrines if doing so will lead to victory.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Select the Devastator Doctrine, 
Tactical Doctrine or Assault Doctrine. Until 
the start of your next Command phase, 
that Combat Doctrine is active for that unit 
instead of any other Combat Doctrine that 
is active for your army, even if you have 
already selected that doctrine this battle. 

STORM OF FIRE

GLADIUS TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

There is no escaping the wrath of the 
Space Marines, and they use their 
weapons to bring swift death to their foes 
wherever they may hide, expertly placing 
their shots to wreak maximum damage.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit have the [IGNORES COVER] ability. 
If your unit is under the effects of the 
Devastator Doctrine, until the end of the 
phase, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of such weapons by 1 
as well. 

ADEPTUS ASTARTES – GLADIUS TASK FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Gladius Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Gladius Task Force Enhancements.
ARTIFICER ARMOUR
Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these 
ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior 
protective capabilities that rival even Terminator 
plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that 
an honoured champion of the Imperium stands 
before them.

ADEPT OF THE CODEX
The commanders of Space Marine strike forces 
epitomise the tactical genius of the Codex Astartes, 
its wisdom guiding them to measured strategic 
responses even amidst the fiercest flames of battle.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer has a Save 
characteristic of 2+ and the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. 
THE HONOUR VEHEMENT
A single stanza of script, the original of which was 
said to have been penned by the Emperor himself, 
the Honour Vehement is inscribed on thrice-blessed 
parchment and affixed with a purity seal upon its 
bearer’s weaponry. So potent is the inspirational 
value of the Emperor’s own evocation that those who 
bear it are driven to heroic acts of martial prowess.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Add 1 to the Attacks 
and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons. While the bearer is under the effects 
of the Assault Doctrine, add 2 to the Attacks and 
Strength characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead.

Captain model only. At the start of your Command 
phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, instead of 
selecting a Combat Doctrine to be active for your 
army, you can select the Tactical Doctrine. If you do, 
until the start of your next Command phase, that 
doctrine is active for the bearer’s unit only, even if you 
have already selected that doctrine to be active for 
your army this battle.
BOLTER DISCIPLINE
To a Space Marine, the boltgun is more than a weapon 
– it is an instrument of Mankind’s divinity, the bringer 
of death to his foes. This commander has drilled his 
warriors relentlessly, and when combined with the 
Adeptus Astartes’ superhuman reflexes, his warriors 
can produce a devastating rate of fire.

Adeptus Astartes model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, ranged weapons equipped by models 
in that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. In 
addition, while the bearer’s unit is under the effects of 
the Devastator Doctrine, each time a model in that unit 
makes a ranged attack, a successful unmodified Hit 
roll of 5+ scores a Critical Hit.

The Drukhari are experts in precise torture, sharp blades, cruel poisons and eldritch abominations. Using the 
labyrinthine network of webway spars, they strike almost anywhere. Realspace raiding parties prey upon worlds 
across the galaxy, surging from hidden portals unknown to those they see merely as cattle or playthings. As the 
Drukhari feed on the souls of the slain, they become imbued with supernatural might, eventually turning into 
killing machines.

POWER FROM PAIN
If your Army Faction is Drukhari, units from your army with this ability can become Empowered Through Pain. 
This is done using Pain tokens.

GAINING PAIN TOKENS
 If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you gain Pain 
tokens as follows:

 ■   At the start of the battle, depending on the 

battle size:  

COMBAT PATROL

INCURSION

STRIKE FORCE

ONSLAUGHT

1 PAIN TOKEN

2 PAIN TOKENS

3 PAIN TOKENS

4 PAIN TOKENS

 ■  Each time an enemy unit is destroyed, you gain 1 

Pain token.

 ■  Each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test, 

you gain 1 Pain token.

Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side – 
this is your Pain token pool.

EMPOWERED THROUGH PAIN
At the start of any phase, you can expend one or more 
Pain tokens from your Pain token pool. Each time you 
do, select one unit from your army with the Power 
from Pain ability. Until the end of the phase, that unit 
is Empowered, and gains the abilities listed below, 
depending on the phase.

 OR 

 ■  Empowered in the Movement or Charge phase:

 ◦  You can re-roll Advance or Charge rolls made for 

that unit.

 OR 

 ■ Empowered in the Shooting or Fight phase:

 ◦  Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, 

you can re-roll the Hit roll.

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Drukhari, you can use this 
Realspace Raiders Detachment rule.

REALSPACE RAIDERS
The three factions of the Drukhari are constantly 
vying for supremacy, each convinced beyond 
doubt of their own innate superiority. This struggle 
manifests during their realspace raids as a frenzy of 
murderously sadistic competition.

At the start of the battle, you gain an additional 1 Pain 
token for each of the following your army contains:

 ■ One or more Archon models
 ■ One or more Succubus models
 ■ One or more Haemonculus models

Designer’s Note: These are all cumulative, so if 
your army contains at least one Archon, at least 
one Succubus and at least one Haemonculus, 
you would start the battle with an additional 3 
Pain tokens.

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Stratagems. 

ACROBATIC DISPLAY
REALSPACE RAIDERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Many Wych Cults favour spectacular 
gymnastic displays. Their fighters are 
never still, springing from one foot to the 
other at blinding speed.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Wych Cult unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit is eligible to declare a charge even if it 
Fell Back or Advanced this turn. 

PREY ON THE WEAK
 REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The scent of a foe in pain draws Drukhari 
to it like hungry predators to an injured 
beast, their senses sharpening at its tang.

1CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Kabal unit from your 
army and one enemy unit that is 
Below Half-strength.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an attack 
that targets that enemy unit, you can 
re-roll the Wound roll. 

STRIKE AND FADE
REALSPACE RAIDERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The Drukhari are masters at using 
hit-and-run tactics, engaging a target 
with a flurry of shots before quickly 
manoeuvring into cover or out of sight.

WHEN: End of your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your 
army (excluding Aircraft).
EFFECT: Your unit can immediately make a 
Normal move. 
RESTRICTIONS: Until the end of the turn, 
your unit is not eligible to declare a charge 
and that unit cannot embark within a 
Transport at the end of this move.

2CP

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Stratagems. 

1CP

INSENSIBLE TO PAIN
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The twisted creations of the Haemonculus 
Covens are insensible to all but the most 
mortal injuries.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Haemonculus Covens unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Wound roll.

1CP1CP

1CP

ALLIANCE OF AGONY
REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Even the most bloodthirsty Drukhari 
will veil their enmity to work together 
against a shared enemy for the same 
gruesome purpose.

WHEN: Start of any phase. 
TARGET: One Archon, one Succubus and 
one Haemonculus from your army.
EFFECT: Discard one Pain token from 
your Pain token pool. Until the end of the 
phase, all three of those models’ units 
are Empowered. 
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem if you are able to select all 
three of the target models stated above. 

QUICKSILVER REACTIONS

REALSPACE RAIDERS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The hyper-fast reflexes of the Drukhari 
allow them to duck and weave to avoid all 
but the swiftest enemy strikes.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Drukhari unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack that targets your unit, 
subtract 1 from the Hit roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target a 
Haemonculus Covens unit from your 
army for this Stratagem. 

DRUKHARI – REALSPACE RAIDERS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Realspace Raiders Detachment rule, you can use these Realspace Raiders Enhancements. 
CRUCIBLE OF MALEDICTION
When opened, the souls of tortured psykers spew 
outward, driving any nearby warp-wielders insane.

BLOOD DANCER
This Succubus is renowned for their expertise 
at close-quarters combat within the arenas of 
Commorragh. The skills they display before the 
baying crowds on the blood-soaked sands are 
equally deadly on the battlefield.

Haemonculus model only. Once per battle, at the 
start of any Shooting phase, the bearer can use this 
Enhancement. When it does, every enemy unit within 
12" must take a Battle-shock test, subtracting 1 from 
that test if the bearer’s unit is currently Empowered. 
Each time a Psyker unit fails this test, it suffers D3 
mortal wounds. 
LABYRINTHINE CUNNING
This Archon has a mind like steel traps, assimilating 
every detail of a situation.

Archon model only. Each time you select the bearer’s 
unit as the target of a Stratagem, roll one D6, adding 3 
to the result if the Stratagem being used is Alliance of 
Agony: on a 4+, you gain 1CP. 

Succubus model only. Improve the Attacks and 
Armour Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons by 1. While the bearer is Empowered, 
Improve the Attacks and Armour Penetration 
characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 
2 instead.
THE ART OF PAIN
Some Drukhari elevate their battle plans to another 
level by creating a spectacle of torment that maims 
and cripples every foe in order to draw out the 
moment of the kill, heightening the pleasure they 
derive before the fatal blow falls.

Drukhari model only. In your Command phase, if the 
bearer is on the battlefield, you gain 1 Pain token.

Raw speed delivers countless light Venom transports to the heart 
of the enemy’s defence, and sees them chase down stragglers and 
encircle the foe’s outriders. For the clique of warriors on board, Venoms 
are mobile firebases and gore-splashed chariots in one, with flickering 
shields that confound attempts to bring them down.

WARGEAR OPTIONS
 ■   This model’s twin splinter rifle can be replaced with 1 splinter cannon.

UNIT COMPOSITION
 ■ 1 Venom
This model is equipped with: splinter cannon; twin splinter 
rifle; bladevanes.

TRANSPORT

This model has a transport capacity of 6 Drukhari Infantry 
models. This model cannot transport Grotesque models or 
models that can Fly. 
Before the battle, at the start of the Declare Battle Formations 
step, you can select one Kabalite Warriors or Wyches unit 
from your army. If you do, that unit is split into two units, each 
containing as equal a number of models as possible (when 
splitting a unit in this way, make a note of which models form 
each of the two new units). One of these units must start the 
battle embarked within this Transport; the other can start 
the battle embarked within another Transport, or it can be 
deployed as a separate unit.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES

Imperial Knights fight by a stringent set of codes to ensure that in addition to defeating the enemy, honour is 
always upheld.

CODE CHIVALRIC
If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, at the 
end of the Read Mission Objectives step, you must 
select one of the Oaths below to be active for your 
army. Models from your army with this ability gain the 
associated Oath ability, and you gain the associated 
Deed to complete.

If, at the start of any of your Command phases, 
your selected Oath’s Deed is completed, your army 
becomes Honoured for the rest of the battle and 
you gain 3CP (you can only gain CP in this way once 
per battle).

LAY LOW THE TYRANT
 ■  Oath Ability: Each time this model is selected to 

shoot or fight, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a 
Wound roll of 1. 

 ■  Deed: This deed is completed if the enemy 

Warlord is destroyed. 

RECLAIM THE REALM
 ■  Oath Ability: Add 1" to this model’s Move 

characteristic and add 1 to Advance and Charge rolls 
made for this model.

 ■  Deed: This deed is completed if you control one 

or more objective markers in your opponent’s 
deployment zone.

BONDSMAN ABILITIES 
Some Questoris models have a Bondsman ability, 
tagged with the word ‘Bondsman’. In your Command 
phase, one or more models from your army with a 
Bondsman ability can use that ability. For each one 
that does, select one friendly Armiger model within 
12" of that model (you cannot select an Armiger 
model that is already being affected by a Bondsman 
ability). Until the start of your next Command phase, 
both of those models (i.e. the model that just used its 
Bondsman ability and the Armiger model you just 
selected) are affected by that Bondsman ability.

SUPER-HEAVY WALKER 
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models 
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that 
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there. 

FREEBLADES 
Freeblades often wander the galaxy, aiding the 
armies of the Imperium against the xenos and 
heretics who threaten the Emperor’s realm.

If every model in your army has the Imperium 
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic 
Imperial Knights model or up to 3 Armiger 
models in your army, even if they do not have 
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select 
Army Faction step. None of these models 
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be 
given Enhancements.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Imperial Knights, you can 
use this Noble Lance Detachment rule.

INDOMITABLE HEROES 
Gathered into a powerful formation known as a lance, 
Imperial Knights and the Nobles who pilot them wage 
their honour-driven assaults with renowned resilience 
and bloody-minded determination.

All Imperial Knights models from your army have 
the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If your army is Honoured, 
those models have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Enhancements.
REVERED KNIGHT (AURA)
Never hesitating before tyrannical invaders, this 
Knight is beheld as the very epitome of honour – a 
monolithic incarnation of the Imperium. While they 
stand, courage is inviolate and victory is assured.

MYTHIC HERO
This warrior is a legendary figure who embodies the 
Code Chivalric, and tales of their deeds have spread 
far and wide. To be a Bondsman to such a warrior is a 
great honour indeed.

Imperial Knights model only. While a friendly 
Imperial Knights model is within 6" of the bearer, 
improve that model’s Leadership characteristic by 1. 
If your army is Honoured, increase the range of this 
Aura ability to 12".
MYSTERIOUS GUARDIAN
Manifesting as though from nowhere, this Noble’s 
titanic steed is an elemental force of vengeance 
against the Emperor of Mankind’s foes. At battle’s end, 
it disappears as mysteriously as it arrived.

Imperial Knights model only. The bearer has the 
Deep Strike ability. Once per battle, at the end of 
your opponent’s turn, if the bearer is not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy units, it can fade 
away. If it does, remove it from the battlefield then, 
in the Reinforcements step of your subsequent 
Movement phase, set it up anywhere on the 
battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from 
all enemy models. If the battle ends and the bearer is 
not on the battlefield, it is destroyed.

Questoris model with a Bondsman ability only. Each 
time the bearer uses its Bondsman ability, you can 
select one additional friendly Armiger model within 
12" of the bearer that is not already being affected 
by a Bondsman ability. Until the start of your next 
Command phase, that model is also affected by that 
Bondsman ability.
BANNER OF MACHARIUS 
TRIUMPHANT
A gift from Lord Solar Macharius himself to honour the 
noble houses that accompanied his crusade, legend 
has it that this banner has never seen defeat: every 
time a Knight has carried it to war, a great victory has 
been won.

Imperial Knights model only. If you control an 
objective marker at the end of your Command phase 
and the bearer is within range of that objective 
marker, that objective marker remains under your 
control even if you have no models within range of it, 
until your opponent controls it at the start or end of 
any turn. 
UNYIELDING PARAGON
This Knight is an unyielding army unto themselves, 
capable of engaging entire enemy forces and holding 
their ground, emerging through the fiercest firestorms 
bloodied, but unbowed.

Questoris model only. Each time an attack is 
allocated to the bearer, worsen the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Stratagems.
THUNDERSTOMP
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

SHOULDER THE BURDEN
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When faced with their darkest hour, knightly 
Nobles rise to the challenge, for nothing 
shall deter them from fulfilling their duty.

1CP

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that has lost one or 
more wounds.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next 
Command phase, improve your model’s 
Move, Toughness, Save, Leadership and 
Objective Control characteristics by 1 and 
each time your model makes an attack, 
add 1 to the Hit roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem once per battle. If your army 
is Honoured, you can use this Stratagem 
one additional time.

ROTATE ION SHIELDS
NOBLE LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Veteran Knight pilots can swiftly angle their 
ion shields to better deflect incoming fire.

1CP

1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
that Imperial Knights model has a 4+ 
invulnerable save against ranged attacks.

The Noble brings their Knight suit’s full 
weight crashing down with the force of 
an industrial piledriver. Few can survive 
such a blow.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that has not been 
selected to fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
your model cannot target Monster or 
Vehicle units, but all melee weapons 
equipped by your model have the 
[DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.

SQUIRES’ DUTY
NOBLE LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Under the scrutiny and judgement of their 
Noble betters, Armiger pilots will redouble 
their efforts, attacking as one to smash 
aside their foes.

WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or 
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more Armiger models 
from your army and one enemy unit 
that is an eligible target for all of those 
Armiger models.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
improve the Strength and Armour 
Penetration characteristics of weapons 
equipped by those Armiger models by 
1. If your army is Honoured, until the 
end of the phase, add 1 to the Damage 
characteristic of those weapons as well.

IMPERIAL KNIGHTS – NOBLE LANCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Noble Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Noble Lance Stratagems.

1CP

TROPHY CLAIM
NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Once a mighty foe is laid low, the 
victorious Knight’s emitters blare its 
triumph, announcing the glory brought 
to the Imperium, but shame awaits those 
who fail in such confrontations.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot or fight this phase, and 
one enemy Monster or Vehicle unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time your model makes an attack that 
targets that enemy unit, add 1 to the 
Wound roll. If your model destroys that 
enemy unit this phase, you gain 1CP, but if 
your model does not destroy that enemy 
unit this phase, you cannot use this 
Stratagem again for the rest of the battle. 

1CP

VALIANT LAST STAND
NOBLE LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Badly wounded, their Knight’s generator 
on the verge of overload, still the Noble 
fights on, drawing upon their reserves of 
chivalric heroism to sell their life as dearly 
as they can.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Imperial Knights model 
from your army that was just destroyed 
and that is eligible to fight but has not 
been selected to fight this phase. You can 
use this Stratagem on that model even 
though it was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Before rolling to see if this model 
deals any mortal wounds as a result of its 
Deadly Demise ability, it can fight; when 
doing so, it is assumed to have 1 wound 
remaining, or all its wounds remaining 
if your army is Honoured. After it has 
finished resolving its attacks, resolve its 
Deadly Demise ability as normal.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target 
Sir Hekhtur with this Stratagem.

TYRANIDS
ARMY RULES

SYNAPSE
Some Tyranids serve as synaptic conduits or nodal 
relays through which a portion of the Hive Mind’s 
iron will flows, overriding the natural instincts of the 
swarm to direct the teeming warrior-beasts to function 
as a single, gestalt organism on the battlefield. 

If your Army Faction is Tyranids, while a Tyranids 
unit from your army is within 6" of one or more 
Synapse models from your army, that unit is said to 
be within Synapse Range of your army. Each time a 
Tyranids unit from your army takes a Battle-shock 
test, if it is within Synapse Range of your army, take 
that test on 3D6 instead of 2D6.

SHADOW IN THE WARP
Tyranids flood the battlefield with the psychic 
signature of the hive fleet, an icy, alien dread that 
gnaws at the minds of their prey and smothers even 
the most stalwart courage. When faced with such 
unfathomable horror, many are driven insane or suffer 
catastrophic neural damage.

If your Army Faction is Tyranids, once per battle, in 
either player’s Command phase, if one or more units 
from your army with this ability are on the battlefield, 
you can unleash the Shadow in the Warp. When you 
do, each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a 
Battle-shock test. 

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Tyranids, you can use this 
Invasion Fleet Detachment rule. 

HYPER-ADAPTATIONS
Every warrior organism in the Tyranid race is 
fashioned by the ineffable alien will of the Hive Mind. 
Their flesh and chitin is endlessly mutable, honed into 
whatever form will prove most lethal to the prey.

At the start of the first battle round, select one of the 
following Hyper-adaptations to be active for Tyranids 
units from your army until the end of the battle:

 SWARMING INSTINCTS 
Each time a Tyranids model with this 
Hyper-adaptation makes an attack that targets an 
enemy Infantry or Swarm unit, that attack has the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

 HYPER-AGGRESSION 
Each time a Tyranids model with this 
Hyper-adaptation makes an attack that targets an 
enemy Monster or Vehicle unit, that attack has the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

 HIVE PREDATORS 
Each time a Tyranids model with this 
Hyper-adaptation makes an attack that targets an 
enemy Character unit, if a Critical Hit is scored, that 
attack has the [PRECISION] ability.

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET

TYRANIDS – INVASION FLEET
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Invasion Fleet Detachment rule, you can use these Invasion Fleet Enhancements.
ALIEN CUNNING
This leader-beast possesses highly sophisticated 
neural pathways, allowing it to identify priority 
strategic assets and adapt the position of its 
warriors to seize them before the foe even recognise 
their value.

SYNAPTIC LINCHPIN
With a cerebral cortex that pulsates with the 
irresistible power of the Hive Mind, this leader acts as 
a blazing synaptic beacon to the lesser creatures of 
the swarm, the better to direct their actions and react 
to the ever-changing state of battle.

Tyranids model only. After both players have 
deployed their armies, select up to three Tyranids 
units from your army and redeploy them. When doing 
so, you can set those units up in Strategic Reserves if 
you wish, regardless of how many units are already in 
Strategic Reserves.
PERFECTLY ADAPTED
This creature was created for one purpose: to 
completely eradicate the defenders of the target 
prey world.

Tyranids model only. Once per turn, you can re-roll 
one Hit roll, one Wound roll, one Damage roll, one 
Advance roll, one Charge roll or one saving throw 
made for the bearer.

Tyranids model only. While a friendly Tyranids unit 
is within 9" of the bearer, that unit is within Synapse 
Range of your army.
ADAPTIVE BIOLOGY
The same weapon rarely works against this 
leader-beast twice, as its alien physiology adapts at 
an astonishing rate to counter the attacks of the foe.

Tyranids model only. The bearer has the Feel No Pain 
5+ ability. At the start of any turn, if the bearer has 
fewer than its starting number of wounds remaining, 
until the end of the battle, it has the Feel No Pain 4+ 
ability instead.

Gargoyles are often the first warrior organisms hurled against a prey 
world. Their teeming swarms darken the skies. Their opportunistic 
attacks spread panic and disarray. Worst of all, the creatures can 
squirm through gaps that appear far too small, bursting through gun 
slits and vent pipes to assail horrified defenders.

GREY KNIGHTS
ARMY RULE

The soul of the Grey Knights is sacrosanct, and their purity is incorruptible. The silvered armour of this 
Chapter’s warriors is bound with incantations, engraved with sigils of warding. Their blades shine with the inner 
light of their sanctity, for each of these Space Marines is a psychic warrior, in empyric communion with his 
battle-brothers. Empowered by minds constantly on guard, they can cut steel with bare hands, their eyes blaze 
with fire and even the power of their words flays the otherworldly skin of daemons. They are the Imperium’s 
foremost sword and shield against the daemonic. Guided by the foresight and prophecies of the Chapter’s 
Prognosticars, a Grey Knight can adapt to the most irrational of foes and, in a flare of teleportation energies, 
emerge at exactly the right location to unleash their devastating power.

TELEPORT ASSAULT
If your Army Faction is Grey Knights, at the end of 
your opponent’s turn, you can select a number of 
Grey Knights units from your army with this ability 
(excluding units that are within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units). The maximum number 
of units you can select depends on the battle size, 
as follows:

COMBAT PATROL

INCURSION

STRIKE FORCE

ONSLAUGHT

UP TO 1 UNIT

UP TO 2 UNITS

UP TO 3 UNITS

UP TO 4 UNITS

Once you have made your selections, 
remove those units from the battlefield. In 
the Reinforcements step of your next 
Movement phase, set each of those 
units up anywhere on the battlefield 
that is more than 9" horizontally 
away from all enemy models. 
Any units that are not on 
the battlefield at the 
end of the battle count 
as destroyed.

GREY KNIGHTS – TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Grey Knights, you can use 
this Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule.

TELEPORT SHUNT
Hardened against the corrupting touch of Chaos, 
protected by silver sigils and the warriors’ own purity 
of spirit, Grey Knights are capable of enduring rapid 
and repeated submersions in the warp. When a 
lightning-fast purgation is required, orbiting strike 
cruisers maintain a constant spiritual lock on their 
battle-brothers, enabling Grey Knights to perform 
short-ranged teleportations. Flickering in and out 
of reality, this exceptional mobility allows them to 
outmanoeuvre the most otherworldly of enemies.

Each time a Grey Knights unit with the Deep Strike 
ability Advances, do not make an Advance roll. 
Instead, until the end of the phase, add 6" to that 
unit’s Move characteristic and that unit can Fly.

GREY KNIGHTS – TELEPORT STRIKE FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Teleport Strike Force Detachment rule, you can use these Teleport Strike 
Force Enhancements.
FIRST TO THE FRAY
Whether braving premature teleportation assaults 
or leaping from the hatch of a transport still aglow 
from atmospheric entry, this sanctified commander 
frequently makes the first strike in battle, and ever 
from an unexpected quarter. Inspired by such zealous 
bravery, his battle-brothers are never far behind.

SIGIL OF EXIGENCE
Forged by the Techmarine Dorvel urThann, this 
small chor-bronze icon contains a powerful teleport 
matrix and a trio of vigilant machine spirits. Their 
pre-cogitative psyroutines guard against attacks 
from afar, spiriting their host and his allies away from 
danger in a blaze of light.

Grey Knights model with the Deep Strike ability only. 
The bearer’s unit must start the battle in Reserves, but 
neither it, nor any Transport it is embarked within, 
is counted towards any limits the mission places on 
the number of Strategic Reserves units you can have. 
That unit can be set up using its Deep Strike ability in 
the Reinforcements step of your first, second or third 
Movement phase, regardless of any mission rules.
DOMINA LIBER DAEMONICA
This tome is said to be a relic of Supreme Grand 
Master Janus, he who mastered all six hundred 
and sixty-six words of banishment, each one 
painstakingly recorded on its pages. In times of need 
a hero of the Chapter will carry this book into battle, 
its bindings crackling with arcane energy as the 
words repel warp entities and send daemons howling 
back into the warp.

Grey Knights model only. Each time the bearer 
makes a melee attack add 1 to the Wound roll and, 
if that attack targets a Daemon unit, add 1 to the 
Damage characteristic of that attack as well.

Grey Knights model only. Once per battle, in your 
opponent’s Shooting phase, when the bearer’s unit 
is selected as the target of a ranged attack, you can 
remove the bearer’s unit from the battlefield and then 
set it back up again anywhere on the battlefield that 
is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy 
models. If the bearer is no longer an eligible target, 
your opponent can then select new targets for any 
attacks that had targeted the bearer’s unit.
INESCAPABLE WRATH
When this warrior leads his battle-brothers into 
the foe, they strike like silver lances of lightning. 
By focusing his powers upon a pivotal moment, he 
connects himself via a tether of inevitability to his 
enemies. Drawn by the tether, he bears down upon 
them with incredible speed, ensuring none escape his 
and his warriors’ wrath.

Grey Knights model only. Add 1 to Charge rolls made 
for the bearer’s unit.

Librarians have a strength of mind greater even than many of the 
powerful battle-psykers with whom they fight. The breadth of their 
empyric scholarship is vast and they courageously brave the deeper 
and more dangerous reaches of the warp, using psychic rites to shield 
their fellows or tear at daemonic forms.

The Black Templars are the most zealous of all the Space Marine Chapters. To them, the Emperor is a literal deity, 
and there is no oath they will not swear, no vow they will not take or bloody act of battlefield worship they will 
not perform in his name. 

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can use 
this Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army cannot include any Adeptus Astartes 

Psyker models, and cannot include any of the 
following models that do not have the Black 
Templars keyword: Gladiator Lancer; Gladiator 
Reaper; Gladiator Valiant; Impulsor; Repulsor; 
Repulsor Executioner.

 ■  Your army can include Black Templars units, but it 

cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn from 
any other Chapter.

TEMPLAR VOWS
On the eve of battle, the warriors of a Black Templars 
crusade gather together to be led in prayer and 
contemplation by their Chaplains. In their righteous zeal, 
united in their hatred of the foe, they swear a mighty vow 
to uphold in the battle ahead.

At the start of the first battle round, select one of the four 
Templar Vows below to be active for Adeptus Astartes 
units from your army until the end of the battle.

 ■  Suffer Not the Unclean to Live: Melee weapons 
equipped by models in this unit have the [LETHAL

 ■  Uphold the Honour of the Emperor: Models in this 

unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability and a Leadership 
characteristic of 5+.

 ■  Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch: Models in this unit 

have a 4+ invulnerable save against Psychic Attacks 
and melee weapons equipped by models in this unit 
have the [ANTI-PSYKER 4+] ability.

 ■  Accept Any Challenge, No Matter the Odds: Melee

FERVENT ACCLAMATION
RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The magnetic force of this Black Templar’s 
oratory inspires his fellow warriors to 
swear great vows, even in the midst of 
the battle.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes 
Character unit from your army.
EFFECT: Select one Templar Vow that is 
not active for your army. Until the start 
of your next Command phase, while that 
Character is leading a unit, models in 
that unit gain the benefits of that vow in 
addition to the vow selected to be active 
for your army at the start of the battle.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has shot.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that had one or more of 
its models destroyed as a result of the 
attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal 
move of up to D6", but it must end that 
move closer to the enemy unit that just 
shot. If the Abhor the Witch, Destroy the 
Witch vow is active for your army, your 
unit can make a Normal move of up to 6" 
instead, but it must end that move either 
closer to the enemy unit that just shot, or 
closer to the closest enemy Psyker unit. 

1CP

Glowing blades and revving chainswords 
close off the foe’s every avenue of escape.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Movement phase, 
when an enemy unit (excluding Vehicles 
and Monsters) is selected to Fall Back.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that is within Engagement 
Range of that enemy unit.
EFFECT: Roll one D6, adding 1 to the result 
if the Accept Any Challenge, No Matter 
the Odds vow is active for your army. On 
a 4+, that enemy unit cannot Fall Back 
this phase and must Remain Stationary. 
Otherwise, that enemy unit can Fall Back 
this phase, but if it does, all models in that

RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Every blow struck against a Black Templar 
is answered in kind. Even as they are 
laid low, their blades still lash out at the 
enemies of the divine Emperor.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, 
if that model has not fought this phase, 
roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if the 
Uphold the Honour of the Emperor vow 
is active for your army. On a 4+, do not 
remove the destroyed model from play; it 
can fight after the attacking model’s unit 
has finished making its attacks, and is 
then removed from play.

1CP

The Black Templars channel their fervour 
into a hate-fuelled flurry of blows.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes a melee 
attack, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1. If the 
Suffer Not The Unclean to Live vow is 
active for your army, add 1 to the Strength 
characteristic of that attack as well. 

 

BLACK TEMPLARS – RIGHTEOUS CRUSADERS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Righteous Crusaders Detachment rule, you can use these Righteous 
Crusaders Enhancements.
PERDITION’S EDGE
With blades carved from noctilith, these axes 
separate the victim’s soul from the warp briefly as 
the death blow is delivered. What is only a moment 
in reality feels like an eternity of damnation to the 
departing spirit – punishment for their sins against 
the immortal Emperor.

SIGISMUND’S SEAL
This sheet of paper-thin adamantine is inscribed with 
an oath of moment taken by Sigismund under the 
gaze of the Emperor himself. Such a relic is gifted only 
to a warrior displaying exemplary martial prowess, 
galvanising the battle-brothers around them to reach 
new heights of righteous ferocity.

Adeptus Astartes model only. 

Adeptus Astartes model only. 

 ■  Improve the Strength and Armour Penetration 

characteristics of the bearer’s melee weapons by 1.
 ■  If the Suffer Not the Unclean to Live vow is active for 
your army, add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of the 
bearer’s melee weapons as well. 
WITCHSEEKER BOLTS
With casings forged from the blades of fallen 
battle-brothers and blessed by the devout priests of 
the Ministorum, these bolt rounds have an unerring 
habit of finding their way to the heart of the witch.

Adeptus Astartes model only. 

 ■  The bearer’s ranged weapons have the [PRECISION], 
[ANTI-PSYKER 4+] and [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] abilities.

 ■  If the Abhor the Witch, Destroy the Witch vow is 

active for your army, each time the bearer makes 
a ranged attack that targets a Psyker unit, you can 
re-roll the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound roll.

 ■  Improve the Attacks characteristic of the bearer’s 

melee weapons by 1. 

 ■  While the bearer is leading a unit, if the Accept Any 
Challenge, No Matter the Odds vow is active for your 
army, each time a model in that unit makes a melee 
attack, a successful unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores 
a Critical Hit.
TÄNNHAUSER’S BONES
Marshal Tännhauser was martyred at the hands 
of the Black Legion at the decisive battle of the 
Rutger’s Reach Crusade. His bones, encased in small 
reliquaries, were distributed amongst the warriors 
of that crusade during the victory sermon. Each is a 
potent reminder of duty and the expectations placed 
upon every Black Templar.

Adeptus Astartes model only.

 ■  Each time an attack is allocated to the bearer, halve 

the Damage characteristic of that attack.

 ■  While the bearer is leading a unit, if the Uphold the 
Honour of the Emperor vow is active for your army, 
models in that unit have the Feel No Pain 5+ ability.

CHAOS DAEMONS
ARMY RULE

When daemons pour into realspace, maelstroms of warp energy spill through in their wake. Manifest emotion 
and unbridled, nightmarish forces twist all that they touch, reshaping the landscape into bizarre forms while 
tormenting mortal beings to madness. To be embroiled in such tempests is to endure conditions utterly 
anathema to the fundamental laws of reality, provoking primal terror in even the most emotionless warriors.

THE SHADOW OF CHAOS
If your Army Faction is Legiones Daemonica, certain 
areas of the battlefield are considered to be within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, as follows: 

 ■  Your deployment zone is always within your army’s 

Shadow of Chaos. 

 ■  At the start of any phase, if you control at least half 
of the objective markers within No Man’s Land, until 
the end of that phase, No Man’s Land is within your 
army’s Shadow of Chaos.

 ■  At the start of any phase, if you control at least half 

of the objective markers within your opponent’s 
deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your 
opponent’s deployment zone is within your army’s 
Shadow of Chaos.

DAEMONIC MANIFESTATION
While a Legiones Daemonica unit from your army is 
within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, each time that 
unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, 
if that test is passed, one model in that unit regains 
up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a Battleline unit 
and that test is passed, up to D3 destroyed models 
can be returned to that unit instead).

DAEMONIC TERROR
While an enemy unit is within your army’s Shadow of 
Chaos, each time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, 
subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that 
enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

 DAEMONIC PACT
When the mortal servants of the Dark Gods 
march to war, the most favoured may find 
daemonic entities accompanying them.

If every model from your army has the 
Chaos keyword, you can include Legiones 
Daemonica units in your army, even if they 
do not have the Faction keyword you selected 
in the Select Army Faction step. The combined 
points cost of such units you can include 
depends on your battle size, as shown below.

 ■ Incursion   
 ■ Strike Force 
 ■ Onslaught  

Up to 250 pts
Up to 500 pts
Up to 750 pts

None of these models can be your Warlord, 
and they cannot be given Enhancements. 
In addition:

 ■ I f your Army Faction is World Eaters, 

you can only include Khorne Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

 ■  If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, 

you can only include Tzeentch Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

 ■  If your Army Faction is Death Guard, 

you can only include Nurgle Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

 ■  If your Warlord is Lucius the Eternal, 
you can only include Slaanesh Legiones 
Daemonica units using these rules.

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
DETACHMENT RULES

If your Army Faction is Legiones Daemonica, you 
can use this Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule.

WARP RIFTS
Daemonic legions tear through the fabric of 
realspace, malevolent entities flickering into being 
like phantasms from a nightmare. Worse still, as 
terror and panic take hold of their victims, so their 
mortal souls become ever easier prey for the entities 
pouring through from the warp.

Each time a Legiones Daemonica unit from your 
army is set up on the battlefield using the Deep 
Strike ability, if it is set up wholly within your army’s 
Shadow of Chaos, it can be set up anywhere that 
is more than 6" horizontally away from all enemy 
models, instead of more than 9".

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic 
Incursion Stratagems.

CORRUPT REALSPACE
DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Daemons instinctively feel the need 
to despoil and corrupt every corner of 
realspace, the better to sustain their 
otherworldly forms.

WHEN: Start of any Command phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that is within range of an 
objective marker you control.
EFFECT: That objective marker is said to 
be Corrupted and remains under your 
control, even if you have no models within 
range of it, until your opponent controls it 
at the start or end of any turn. In addition, 
while an objective marker is Corrupted 
and under your control, the area of the 
battlefield within 6" of that objective 
marker is considered to be within your 
army’s Shadow of Chaos. 

WARP SURGE
DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The winds of the warp blow strong, 
invigorating daemonkind and lending 
them supernatural speed and ferocity.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that is within your army’s 
Shadow of Chaos.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit is eligible to declare a charge even if it 
Advanced this turn.

1CP

DRAUGHT OF TERROR
DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The swelling fear of their mortal prey serves 
as an intoxicating elixir to the daemonic 
followers, each draught invigorating their 
forms with deadly power.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica 
unit from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of weapons equipped by 
models in that unit by 1. In addition, 
until the end of the phase, each time 
such a weapon targets a unit that is 
Battle-shocked, you can re-roll the 
Wound roll.

DENIZENS OF THE WARP
DAEMONIC INCURSION – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Ever lurking in the warp, daemons will 
wait until the barriers between realms thin 
before tearing their way into realspace. 

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Legiones Daemonica unit 
from your army that is arriving using the 
Deep Strike ability this phase.
EFFECT: Your unit can be set up anywhere 
on the battlefield that is more than 3" 
horizontally away from all enemy models.
RESTRICTIONS: A unit targeted by this 
Stratagem is not eligible to declare a 
charge in the same turn.

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic 
Incursion Stratagems.

1CP

THE REALM OF CHAOS
DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When the energies of the warp bleed into 
realspace, the Legiones Daemonica can rip 
open portals in seeming thin-air, returning 
to their hellscapes only to rematerialise 
amidst their foes a heartbeat later.

WHEN: End of your opponent’s turn.
TARGET: Up to two Legiones Daemonica 
units from your army that are within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, or one 
other Legiones Daemonica unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Remove the targeted units 
from the battlefield and place them into 
Strategic Reserves. They will arrive back 
on the battlefield in the Reinforcements 
step of your next Movement phase using 
the Deep Strike ability.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot target units 
that are within Engagement Range of one 
or more enemy units with this Stratagem.

1CP

DAEMONIC INVULNERABILITY
DAEMONIC INCURSION – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Daemons are madness given form. Their 
very bodies are fashioned from the stuff 
of the warp, and are difficult to destroy 
through conventional means. 

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase,

CHAOS DAEMONS – DAEMONIC INCURSION
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Daemonic Incursion Detachment rule, you can use these Daemonic 
Incursion Enhancements.
A’RGATH, THE KING OF BLADES
When a daemon is bound within a weapon by its 
infernal master, it rarely submits willingly to this 
terrible incarceration. The same cannot be said for 
A’rgath. A lifetime of slaughter and zealous dedication 
saw this butcher granted daemonhood. Such was 
his devotion to Khorne that instead of accepting 
immortality as a Daemon Prince, he instead chose 
to take the form of a deadly blade so that he could 
spill the lifeblood of Khorne’s greatest enemies. Their 
hand guided by A’rgath’s spirit, this weapon’s wielder 
becomes nigh on unstoppable. Countless are the 
rival champions and mortal heroes that have fallen 
to his power.

THE ENDLESS GIFT
Only the most accomplished plague daemons are 
granted the Endless Gift. A disease of unutterable 
malignancy and repulsive beneficence, it changes 
form constantly from plague to infestation to malaise. 
The one constant is its ability to reknit its sufferer’s 
corporeal form from even the most catastrophic of 
wounds. One moment, infernal bacteria may multiply 
like wildfire until their gelid mass fills a fleshy rent 
with fresh daemon-flesh. The next, pestilential 
vapours may billow from the daemon’s yawning 
maw, veiling its ravaged bulk before tattering away to 
reveal a form healed of its recent hurts.

Khorne Legiones Daemonica model only. Add 1 
to the Attacks and Strength characteristics of the 
bearer’s melee weapons. While the bearer is within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, add 2 to the Attacks 
and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead.
THE EVERSTAVE
This staff blazes with vibrant warpflame. As soon as 
its master takes up the eldritch weapon, they too are 
wreathed in the same daemonic fire. From within this 
magenta inferno, the Everstave’s daemonic bearer 
hurls searing gouts of Tzeentch’s pink fire, turning 
armour to ash and immolating or irrevocably mutating 
the flesh beneath.

Tzeentch Legiones Daemonica model only. Add 1 
to the Strength characteristic of the bearer’s ranged 
weapons and increase the Range characteristic 
of such weapons by 3". While the bearer is within 
your army’s Shadow of Chaos, add 2 to the Strength 
characteristic of the bearer’s ranged weapons and 
increase the Range characteristic of such weapons 
by 6" instead.

Nurgle Legiones Daemonica model only. The bearer 
has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. While the bearer is 
within your army’s Shadow of Chaos, the bearer has 
the Feel No Pain 4+ ability instead.
SOULSTEALER
This gluttonous blade gulps down the souls of its 
victims before invigorating the corporeal form of its 
wielder. Its greed stems from the starving Keeper of 
Secrets bound within – an arrogant entity that sought 
to devour enough Aeldari souls to challenge Slaanesh 
itself. As punishment for the daemon’s monstrous 
hubris, Slaanesh trapped it within Soulstealer, 
condemning the Keeper of Secrets to sustain other 
daemons with its frenzied appetite while retaining 
nothing for itself.

Slaanesh Legiones Daemonica model only. Each 
time the bearer destroys an enemy model with a 
melee attack, roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if the 
bearer is within your army’s Shadow of Chaos. On a 
4+, the bearer regains 1 lost wound.

The symphonies of torment and cacophonies of bliss unleashed by 
these daemons can tear their foes apart body and soul. Yet perhaps 
their greatest ability is to draw the disembodied energies of fellow 
Slaaneshi daemons to the battlefield, constantly bolstering their

ADEPTA SORORITAS
ARMY RULE

The Battle Sisters of the Adepta Sororitas bear the holy weaponry with which the Emperor’s legions conquered 
the galaxy, and illuminate the faithless in lethal volleys from the holy trinity of bolter, flamer and melta weapons. 
It is said the Emperor’s benediction touches each of these warriors, manifesting as a nimbus of holy light in 
which his power is revealed in miraculous deeds of fortitude and divine strength.

ACTS OF FAITH
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, each unit from your army with this ability can perform one Act of Faith 
per phase. This is done using Miracle dice.

GAINING MIRACLE DICE
If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you gain 1 
Miracle dice:

 ■ At the start of each turn.
 ■  Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your 

army is destroyed.

Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The 
number you roll is the value of that Miracle dice. This 
value cannot be changed or re-rolled, unless a rule 
specifically states otherwise. Keep your Miracle dice 
to one side – this is your Miracle dice pool. 

PERFORMING AN ACT OF FAITH
Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your 
army with the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one 
or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can 
perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the 
dice from your Miracle dice pool to substitute that 
dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g. a 
Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can 
be substituted). The dice that is being substituted is 
not rolled; instead the value of the selected Miracle 
dice is used as if it had been rolled (this counts as 
an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules 
purposes). Each Miracle dice can only be selected for 
substitution once. Once all Miracle dice substitutions 
have been made, remove the chosen Miracle dice 
from your Miracle dice pool, and roll all remaining, 
unsubstituted dice that are a part of the dice roll. You 
can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of 
Faith for any of the following types of dice roll:

 ■  Advance roll
 ■ Battle-shock test
 ■ Charge roll
 ■ Damage roll
 ■ Hit roll
 ■ Saving throw
 ■ Wound roll

Example: Instead of rolling 2D6 to take a unit’s 
Battle-shock test, you could use one dice from 
your Miracle dice pool. If the value of that dice was 
4, the unit’s Battle-shock test would be determined 
by rolling one D6 and adding 4 to it (i.e. it would 
be D6+4).

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adepta Sororitas, you can 
use this Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule. 

THE BLOOD OF MARTYRS 
The blood of martyrs is the life force of the Imperium. 
So do the tenets of this Order joyously proclaim, and 
in its warriors’ darkest hour does the sacrifice of their 
fallen Sisters shine brightest. 

Each time an Adepta Sororitas model from your 
army makes an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll if that 
model’s unit is below its Starting Strength, and add 1 
to the Wound roll, as well, if that model’s unit is Below 
Half-strength. For the purposes of this ability, if a 
unit has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to 
be below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or 
more wounds.

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Stratagems.

1CP

DIVINE INTERVENTION
HALLOWED MARTYRS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Sometimes, a brush with death is so close 
the only explanation is divine intervention.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas 
Character unit from your army that 
was just destroyed. You can use this 
Stratagem on that unit even though it was 
just destroyed.
EFFECT: Discard 1-3 Miracle dice. At the 
end of the phase, set the last destroyed 
model from your unit back up on the 
battlefield, as close as possible to 
where it was destroyed and not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy models. 
That model is set back up with a number 
of wounds remaining equal to the number 
of Miracle dice you discarded.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select Saint 
Celestine as the target of this Stratagem. 
You cannot select the same Character 
as the target of this Stratagem more than 
once per battle.

LIGHT OF THE EMPEROR
HALLOWED MARTYRS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Emperor’s radiance shines upon his 
warriors, emboldening them amidst the 
thick of battle in their darkest hour.

WHEN: Command phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit 
from your army that is below its Starting 
Strength. For the purposes of this 
Stratagem, if a unit has a Starting Strength 
of 1, it is considered to be below its 
Starting Strength while it has lost one or 
more wounds.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your 
unit can ignore any or all modifiers to 
its characteristics and/or to any roll or 
test made for it (excluding modifiers to 
saving throws).

HOLY RAGE
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

With psalms on their lips, the faithful hurl 
themselves forward, striking the foe down 
with the inner strength born of faith in 
the Emperor.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes a melee 
attack, add 1 to the Wound roll.

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Stratagems.

REJOICE THE FALLEN
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

The death of a Battle Sister only stirs 
the survivors to fight harder to exact 
swift vengeance.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has resolved 
its attacks.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit 
from your army that had one or more of 
its models destroyed as a result of the 
attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
only that enemy unit when doing so, and 
can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target.

2CP

SPIRIT OF THE MARTYR
HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Even with their dying act, the Sororitas 
mete out the Emperor’s judgement.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making attacks, 
and is then removed from play.

SUFFERING & SACRIFICE

HALLOWED MARTYRS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Suffering is a staple prayer for the Adepta 
Sororitas, and a martyr’s fate only brings 
greater glory to the God-Emperor.

WHEN: Start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adepta Sororitas Infantry 
or Adepta Sororitas Walker unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an enemy model within Engagement 
range of your unit selects targets, it must 
select your unit as the target of its attacks.

ADEPTA SORORITAS – HALLOWED MARTYRS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Hallowed Martyrs Detachment rule, you can use these Hallowed Martyrs Enhancements.
SAINTLY EXAMPLE
With her final breath is another heroine elevated to 
the ranks of sainthood, her death stirring her greatest 
companions to finish what she started.

Adepta Sororitas model only. When the bearer is 
destroyed, you gain an additional D3 Miracle dice.
BLADE OF SAINT ELLYNOR
This blade is forged from thrice-blessed silver, 
quenched in the blood of a hundred martyred heroes. 
On one side the names and deeds of a thousand 
saints are inscribed on the molecular level, while the 
other side is etched with the entire Fede Imperialis. 
The blade glows with righteous power and has slain 
heretics, mutants and xenos beyond counting.

Adepta Sororitas model only. Add 1 to the 
Attacks, Strength and Damage characteristics of 
the bearer’s melee weapons. If the bearer has lost 
one or more wounds, add 2 to the Attacks, Strength 
and Damage characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead. 

LITANIES OF FAITH
When Sebastian Thor was declared Ecclesiarch in 
the wake of the Age of Apostasy, his first sermon 
was transcribed onto scrolls by an army of scribes. 
Today, only a single original copy remains, kept in a 
stasis vault beneath the Convent Prioris on Terra and 
released only with the sanction of the Ecclesiarch 
himself. This unassuming parchment is one of the 
holiest relics in the Ministorum’s charge, its mere 
presence enough to fill the hearts of the faithful with 
righteous fervour.

Adepta Sororitas model only. At the end of your 
Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield, 
you can re-roll one Miracle dice from your Miracle dice 
pool and return it to your Miracle dice pool with the 
new result you rolled. When doing so, if the bearer has 
lost one or more wounds or is leading a unit that is 
Below Half-strength, you can re-roll up to three Miracle 
dice in this way instead.
MANTLE OF OPHELIA
The Mantle of Ophelia was once the badge of office 
for the Prioress of the Convent Sanctorum, and was 
worn by Helena the Virtuous, a Living Saint and one of 
the most revered leaders in the history of the Adepta 
Sororitas. The mantle is thought to have sacred 
powers of protection, for Helena was said to have 
anointed it with the Tears of the Emperor, a phial of 
blood-like liquid meticulously collected over a century 
from weeping statues of the Emperor found across 
the cardinal worlds of the Imperium.

Canoness or Palatine model only. Each time an 
attack is allocated to the bearer, change the Damage 
characteristic of that attack to 1.

Some Adepta Sororitas unit champions can be equipped

listed on this card.

Before selecting targets for this weapon, select one of its profiles to make attacks with.

AGENTS OF THE IMPERIUM
ARMY RULE

Throughout the Imperium there exist numerous martial 
organisations and shadowy institutions. Bodies of armed 
warriors or solitary agents from these groups possess 
specialist skills, unusual equipment and vested interests 
that lead them to be attached to larger Imperial armies. 
Some are requisitioned by the army’s commander for their 
particular abilities, others are assigned by their hidden 
masters to achieve singular agendas. The most powerful 
have the authority and reputation to enforce their presence 
on the field of battle.

ASSIGNED AGENTS
If every model in your army has the Imperium keyword, 
you can include Agents of the Imperium units in your 
army even if they do not have the Faction keyword you 
selected in the Select Army Faction step. The maximum 
number of Agents of the Imperium units you can include 
in your army depends on the battle size, as shown below.

THOUSAND SONS
ARMY RULE

The Thousand Sons channel their arcane power through battlefield ritual, beseeching the Changer of the Ways to 
gift them forbidden knowledge or ravage their foes with warpfire and mutation.

CABAL OF SORCERERS
If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, at the end of your Command phase, each model from your army with 
this ability that is on the battlefield (excluding Battle-shocked models) generates you a number of Cabal points 
equal to the number shown in its ability (e.g. a model with the Cabal of Sorcerers 2 ability would generate you 
2 Cabal points). The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool. During the battle round, you can use 
Rituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do 
not have enough Cabal points for a Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase. At the 
start of your next Command phase, your Cabal points pool resets to zero. Each time you use a Ritual, select one 
Thousand Sons Psyker model from your army, then apply that Ritual’s effect using that Psyker.

WEAVER OF FATES (PSYCHIC)
2 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once during 
that phase, when a saving throw is failed for a friendly 
Thousand Sons model whose unit is within 18" of 
this Psyker, you can re-roll that saving throw.

ECHOES FROM THE WARP (PSYCHIC)
6 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once this 
phase, you can select this Psyker’s unit as the target 
of a Stratagem for 0CP, even if you have already used 
that Stratagem this phase.

TEMPORAL SURGE (PSYCHIC)
5 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase. 
Select one friendly Thousand Sons unit within 18" 
of this Psyker; unless that unit is within Engagement 
Range of one or more enemy units, it can make a 
Normal move. If it does, that unit is not eligible to 
declare a charge this turn.

DOOMBOLT (PSYCHIC)
7 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of your Shooting phase. 
Select one enemy unit within 18" of and visible to 
this Psyker and roll one D6: on a 1, that enemy unit 
suffers D3 mortal wounds; on a 2-5, it suffers D3+3 
mortal wounds; on a 6, it suffers D3+6 mortal wounds. 

TWIST OF FATE (PSYCHIC)
9 CABAL POINTS
Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Select one 
enemy unit within 18" of and visible to this Psyker; 
until the end of the phase, armour saving throws 
cannot be made for models in that unit.

THOUSAND SONS – CULT OF MAGIC
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Thousand Sons, you can use 
this Cult of Magic Detachment rule.

KINDRED SORCERY
For an instant, the chanting voices of the Thousand 
Sons achieve perfect synchronisation, words of

some cursed bell amidst the empyrean.

In your Command phase, you can select 
one of the abilities listed below to 
take effect until the start of your next 
Command phase.

MALEVOLENT CHARGE
Psychic weapons equipped by 
Thousand Sons models from your army

SORCEROUS MIGHT
CULT OF MAGIC – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

[IGNORES COVER] abilities. 

THOUSAND SONS – CULT OF MAGIC
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Cult of Magic Detachment rule, you can use these Cult of Magic Enhancements.
LORD OF FORBIDDEN LORE
This sorcerer has committed many a grimoire and 
unholy tome to memory, giving him unparalleled 
knowledge of hexes, curses and destructive rites.

UMBRALEFIC CRYSTAL
By siphoning the perpetual gloom from the location 
where the cursed planet Mangel III once existed in 
realspace, a cabal of sorcerers from the Cult of Magic 
created the Umbralefic Crystal. One in command of 
this powerful relic can use its energies to temporarily 
fold space, creating a gate of sorcerous translocation 
through which he or his allies can step.

Thousand Sons Psyker model only. The bearer can 
be selected to use a Ritual even if another Psyker 
from your army has already been selected to use that 
Ritual this phase.
ATHENAEAN SCROLLS
Ahriman consumed the knowledge contained in 
the Athenaeum of Kallimakus long ago, but not all 
of the Athenaeum’s founders were slain when their 
repository of knowledge was destroyed. Some of their 
lore has since been transcribed to keep an echo of 
that great library in existence. One who possesses 
these texts has access to techniques that make his 
spells exceptionally potent.

Thousand Sons Psyker model only. In your 
Command phase, if the bearer is on the battlefield and 
is not Battle-shocked, it generates you 1 additional 
Cabal point this phase. 

Thousand Sons model only. Once per battle, in your 
Command phase, you can remove the bearer’s unit 
from the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements 
step of your next Movement phase, set that unit back 
up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" 
horizontally away from all enemy models. 
ARCANE VORTEX
This ritualistic locus is formed from the matter of 
arcane objects, their substance broken down at 
a molecular level and added to a nexus of energy 
surrounding the creator. When battle is joined, the 
sorcerer draws upon this power, all the better to 
unleash warp-fuelled destruction upon the enemy.

Thousand Sons model only. Add 1 to the Strength 
and Damage characteristics of Psychic weapons 
equipped by the bearer.

DEATH GUARD
ARMY RULE

The Death Guard are carriers of countless infections 
and contagions, each a gift from Nurgle. Whenever 
they march to war, they contaminate all around them, 
overwhelming their victims’ immune systems and 
undoing metallic bonds, alien psychic materials and all 
manner of other components, rendering even armoured 
vehicles vulnerable.

NURGLE’S GIFT (AURA)
If your Army Faction is Death Guard, while an enemy 
unit is within Contagion Range of this unit, subtract 
1 from the Toughness characteristic of models in that 
enemy unit. Contagion Range changes over the course of 
the battle, as shown below.

CONTAGION RANGE

1st Battle Round: Contagion Range = 3"

3"

2nd Battle Round: Contagion Range = 6"

3rd Battle Round Onwards: Contagion Range = 9"

DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Death Guard, you can use this 
Plague Company Detachment rule.

SPREAD THE SICKNESS
To the Death Guard, spreading Nurgle’s gifts goes 
beyond the beings they fight – even the landscapes 
they tread upon they seek to corrupt, cultivating 
Nurgle’s garden as widely as possible.

If you control an objective marker at the end of your 
Command phase and a Death Guard unit from your 
army is within range of that objective marker, that 
objective marker is said to be Infected and remains 
under your control even if you have no models within 
range of it, until your opponent controls it at the start 
or end of any turn. In addition, while an objective 
marker is Infected and under your control, it has the 
Nurgle’s Gift ability as if it were a unit from your army 
(so enemy units within Contagion Range of it will have 
their Toughness characteristic modified).

BOILBLIGHT
PLAGUE COMPANY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The strange lumps that form on victims 
of Boilblight – also known as Nurgle’s 
Fruit, Lumpen Splatter or the Crawling 
Pustulence – are easy to spot at a 
distance for the Death Guard.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from 
your army, and one enemy unit within 
Contagion Range of that unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a weapon equipped by a Death 
Guard model from your army targets that 
enemy unit, that weapon has the [HEAVY] 
and [IGNORES COVER] abilities.

CLOUD OF FLIES
PLAGUE COMPANY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP1CP

With a thrumming roar, a thick cloud of 
daemon flies whirls around the Death Guard 
and obscures them from the enemy’s sight.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Death Guard unit from your 
army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit has the Stealth ability.

DEATH GUARD – PLAGUE COMPANY
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Plague Company Detachment rule, you can use these Plague Company Enhancements.
LIVING PLAGUE
Saturated as he is with Nurgle’s contagious blessings, 
merely to stand before this warlord is to be assailed 
by an oppressive aura of plague.

DEADLY PATHOGEN
When this pathogen finds a victim – whether organic 
or machine – it rapidly replicates, causing horrific 
damage before burning out.

Death Guard model only. Add 3" to the range of the 
bearer’s Aura abilities (including Nurgle’s Gift).
THE DRONING (AURA)
This warrior is surrounded by a cloud of dreaded 
plague flies that harass the Death Guard’s enemies 
and feed on their sanity.

Death Guard model only. While an enemy unit is 
within Contagion Range of the bearer, each time that 
unit fails a Battle-shock test, roll one D6: on a 2-5, that 
unit suffers 1 mortal wound; on a 6, that unit suffers 
D3 mortal wounds.

Death Guard model only. Add 1 to the Strength 
and Attacks characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons. While the bearer is within range of an 
Infected objective marker you control, add 2 to the 
Strength and Attacks characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons instead.
SHAMBLEROT
The strains of the zombie virus carried by the Death 
Guard slowly but surely break mortals around 
them, sapping their strength and dexterity before 
consuming them utterly.

Death Guard model only. Each time the bearer’s unit 
is selected as a target of an enemy unit’s charge, until 
the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls 
made for that enemy unit.

NECRONS
ARMY RULE

The scattered dynasties of the Necrons pursue many 
different paths to dominance, embracing their own 
traditions and martial doctrines. All dynasties also benefit 
from the nigh-supernatural technologies that once saw 
them dominate the galaxy, perhaps the most unsettling 
of which are their reanimation protocols. Should a Necron 
be slain, its body becomes wreathed in an eerie glow. 
Crawling limbs reattach, sundered torsos and smashed 
skulls reform and the Necron rises again, shambling back 
into battle.

REANIMATION PROTOCOLS
If your Army Faction is Necrons, at the end of your 
Command phase, each unit from your army with this 
ability activates its Reanimation Protocols and reanimates 
D3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:

 ■  If that unit contains one or more models with fewer 

than their starting number of wounds remaining, 
select one of those models; that model regains one 
lost wound. 

 ■  If all models in that unit have their starting number of 

wounds, but that unit is not at its Starting Strength, 
one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one 
wound remaining. 

Once such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its 
models have their starting number of wounds, nothing 
further happens.

Example: A unit of Lokhust Destroyers (which have a 
Wounds characteristic of 3) activates its Reanimation 
Protocols. The unit had a Starting Strength of 3, but 
currently contains 2 models, and one of those models 
has lost 1 wound. A 3 is rolled to see how many 
wounds are reanimated. The first of these reanimated 
wounds restores the wounded Lokhust Destroyer 
back to 3 wounds. The second of these reanimated 
wounds returns the destroyed Lokhust Destroyer to the 
battlefield with 1 wound remaining. The third of these 
reanimated wounds restores one of the remaining lost 
wounds to the same Lokhust Destroyer that was just 
returned. The unit now contains 3 models, two 
of which have 3 wounds remaining and one of 
which has 2 wounds remaining.

NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Necrons, you can use this 
Awakened Dynasty Detachment rule.

COMMAND PROTOCOLS
The Necron nobility make war in a codified and relentless 
fashion. Their command protocols crackle out across 
multi-dimensional spectra from carrier-wave projectors, 
compelling their semi-sentient soldiery into battle one 
overriding directive at a time.

While a Necrons Character model is leading this unit, 
each time a model in this unit makes an attack, add 1 to 
the Hit roll.

NECRONS – AWAKENED DYNASTY

EFFECT: Set your model back up on the 
battlefield as close as possible to where 
it was destroyed and more than 1" away 
from all enemy models, with half of its 
starting number of wounds remaining.  
RESTRICTIONS: Each model can only 
be targeted with this Stratagem once 
per battle.

1CP

The Necrons strike with data-augmented 
accuracy, their murderous attacks as 
inescapable as the killing cold of space.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that has not been selected to fight 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, add 
1 to the Strength characteristic of melee 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit. In addition, If a Necrons Character 
is leading your unit, until the end of the 
phase, improve the Armour Penetration

PROTOCOL OF THE CONQUERING TYRANT

AWAKENED DYNASTY – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The legions employ the strategies of their 
masters in perfect synchronicity, laying 
down hails of mechanically coordinated fire.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that has not been selected to shoot 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an attack 
that targets a unit within half of the firing

roll. If a Necrons Character is leading 
your unit, until the end of the phase, this 
effect applies at the firing weapon’s full 
range instead.

AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

In response to enemy attack, criss-cross 
fire leaps from the Necron ranks, forming 
a blazing corona of deadly energy from 
which there can be no escape. 

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has resolved 
its attacks.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that had one or more of its models 
destroyed as a result of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
the enemy unit that just attacked it, and 
can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target. In addition, if a Necrons 
Character is leading your unit, until 
the end of the phase, ranged weapons 
equipped by models in your unit have the 
[IGNORES COVER] ability. 

1CP

1CP

At a hissing static signal, nanoscarabs 
are released in boiling black clouds 
that whirl about the legions and effect 
constant repairs.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from your 
army that had one or more of its models 
destroyed as a result of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit activates its 
Reanimation Protocols and reanimates 
D3 wounds. When doing so, if a Necrons 
Character is leading your unit, your unit 
reanimates D3+1 wounds instead.

PROTOCOL OF THE SUDDEN STORM

AWAKENED DYNASTY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Arcing energies leap from one Necron unit 
to the next, lending speed to their limbs 
and causing their eye lenses to blaze.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Necrons unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in your unit 
have the [ASSAULT] ability. In addition, if a

through a miracle of arcane science.

Necrons model only. Once per battle, at the end of 
your opponent’s turn, if the bearer’s unit is not within 
Engagement Range of any enemy units, the bearer 
can use this Enhancement. If it does, remove that 
unit from the battlefield. Then, in the Reinforcements 
step of your next Movement phase, set up that unit 
anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" 
horizontally away from all enemy models.
HYPERMATERIAL ABLATOR
By simply pointing and activating this slender 
quasinium rod, the bearer shrouds their allies in a 
whirling field of accumulated hypermatter.

Necrons model only. While the bearer is leading 
a unit, models in that unit have the Stealth ability. 
In addition, each time a ranged attack targets the 
bearer’s unit, if the attacker is not within 12", models 
in that unit have the Benefit of Cover.

Necrons model only. While a friendly Necrons unit 
is within 6" of the bearer, that unit counts as being led 
by a Necrons Character model.

Designer’s Note: This means that units within range 
of this Aura ability will benefit from the Command 
Protocols ability and will count as containing a 
Character for the purposes of any Awakened 
Dynasty Stratagems.
SEMPITERNAL WEAVE
Only the finest Cryptek artificers know the secret of 
crafting a Sempiternal Weave. These gossamer-thin 
plates are formed from phase-hardened amarathine 
and threads of adamantine. They are then layered 
over the bearer’s carapace of living metal, stiffening 
and contracting when struck to turn aside energy 
blades, bolt shells and even the searing heat of a 
plasma burst.

Necrons model only. The bearer has the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

The Destroyer Cults think nothing of sacrificing their physical forms to 
optimise themselves for slaughter. Lokhust Heavy Destroyers skim to 
battle upon repulsor-sled bodies, their upper limbs bound into gauss 
destructors or enmitic exterminators with which they decimate their 
foes with devastating blasts from afar.

FIELD MANUAL

VERSION 1.0

Welcome to the Munitorum Field Manual. This document contains the most up-to-date points values that should be used in 
your games, covering all the factions in Warhammer 40,000.

You can use this document to determine the points (pts) value 
of each unit in your army. Each entry lists the increments to 
a unit’s size that incur different points costs. This may change 
with the addition of each individual model (e.g. 1 model, 2 
models, 3 models, etc.) or it may be presented with a lower 
and upper limit to a unit’s Starting Strength (e.g. one cost for 
5 models, another cost for 10 models). In the latter case, your 
units can contain a number of models in between these limits, 
but you must still pay the maximum points cost for a unit 

that starts the game with more than its minimum number of 
models. You can learn more about using points to muster your 
army on pages 55-56 of the Core Rules.

This document lists the points values for every unit that, at 
the time of publication, is supported for Warhammer 40,000 – 
including those available from Forge World – and these replace 
any points values published previously. It will be updated 
periodically to reflect the latest publications and to support 
game balance.

Core Rules
‘ W e are beset on all sides by vile predatory aliens 
and sedition gnaws at us from within; in this dark hour 
the best we can do is look to our wargear and pray to our gods.’
- Skolak a’Trellar IV, Imperial Commander

Welcome to the Warhammer 40,000 
Core Rules! The following pages contain 
everything you need to know in order to wage glorious battle across the war-torn galaxy of the 41st Millennium.
Warhammer 40,000 is a tabletop war 
game in which players command armies of Citadel miniatures and attempt to defeat their opponent through a mixture 
of skill, tactics and luck. Storytelling is 
at the core of Warhammer 40,000, with the rules designed to bring to life the epic conflicts between the forces of Mankind, aliens and daemons in the grim darkness of the far future. The purpose of the game is for all players to have an enjoyable shared experience, putting their tactical skills to the test while admiring the spectacle of amazing miniatures clashing on fantastic battlefields. In this spirit, good sportsmanship and politeness are at the heart of the game.Games of Warhammer 40,000 are won by scoring more Victory points than your opponent through achieving various objectives, from recovering vital relics to capturing enemy strongholds or eliminating the opposing Warlord.
The game is played in a series of battle 
rounds, broken into different phases during which players move, shoot and 
fight with their miniatures.In a game as wide-ranging as 
Warhammer 40,000, there may be times when you are not sure exactly how to resolve a situation that has come up during play. When this happens, have a quick chat with your opponent and apply the solution that makes the most sense to both of you (or seems the most fun!). If no single solution presents itself, you and your opponent should roll off, 
and whoever rolls highest gets to choose 
what happens. Then you can get on with the fighting!Introduction

CORE CONCEPTS (PG 5-9)
An introduction to the essential rules terms and concepts 
that underpin every Warhammer 40,000 battle.
THE BATTLE ROUND (PG 10-36)
From manoeuvring your army to unleashing thunderous firepower and brutal assaults, the action in Warhammer 40,000 unfolds in a series of battle rounds in which each player takes a turn.
DATASHEETS AND UNIT 
ABILITIES (PG 37-39)
Every Warhammer 40,000 unit has a datasheet, reflecting 
the characteristics and abilities they can draw upon in battle.
STRATEGIC RESERVES AND 
STRATAGEMS (PG 41-43)
From well-timed Strategic Reserves to deftly executed 
Stratagems, gifted generals make use of all the tactical advantages at their disposal.
TERRAIN FEATURES (PG 44-52)
Warhammer 40,000 battles are fought across all manner of grim and perilous landscapes, often strewn with ruins, wreckage and other obstacles your forces must navigate while they fight.
MUSTER YOUR ARMY (PG 55-56)
Use these steps before battle to organise your warriors and war machines into a formidable fighting force.
MISSIONS  (PG 57-60)
Before committing your forces to war, you must first establish your strategic goals and the nature of the battlefield to be fought over. This section presents the essential steps involved in preparing for any kind of Warhammer 40,000 battle.ABILITIES
Many units in Warhammer 40,000 have one or more abilities listed on their datasheets that they can use in battle. Some of the most common of these are not written out in full on those datasheets, but are instead only referenced by name; the full details of these can be found on the Core Rules pages ahead, marked with the symbol shown on the right.

Some pages feature Hints and Tips, covering topics like dice-rolling practices and how to ensure you don’t damage your models while moving them around the battlefield. Note that these are not rules, they are simply pieces of advice you may find useful to apply to 
your own games.
SUMMARIES
Some rules on the pages ahead include 
bullet-pointed summaries for quick reference purposes. Note that these are not comprehensive, and you should always consult the full rules if you are unsure.
PAGE NUMBERS
Throughout the Core Rules you will find page numbers shown within stylised triangles (see below). These function independently from any other page numbers within a publication; any page references found within the Core Rules – and any page references to the Core Rules found elsewhere – are based on this system, and do not 
relate to any other page 
numbers outside of the Core Rules.
MISSIONS
To play a game of Warhammer 40,000, you must first select a 
mission. The mission will tell you how to muster your armies, create your battlefield and deploy your forces on the tabletop. It will also tell you any special rules that apply to the battle, and (most importantly!) what you need to do to win. Y ou can find out more about missions on pages 57-58.
ARMIES
Each player in a game of Warhammer 40,000 commands an army of Citadel miniatures, hereafter referred to as models. The mission you have selected will guide you as to how big your army should be. 
 ■Army: All of the models under your command.
UNITS
Models move and fight in units. A unit can have one or more models from a single datasheet (see below). Models and units from the same army are said to be friendly in relation to each other. Models and units from your opponent’s army are referred to as enemy models and units. If a rule affects ‘models’ or ‘units’ without specifying that they are friendly or enemy, that rule affects all models or all units, regardless of whose army they are in.
 ■Unit: One or more models from the same datasheet.
 ■ Friendly Models/Units: All models/units from the 
same army.
 ■ Enemy Models/Units: All models/units from your 
opponent’s army.
DATASHEETS
The rules you will need to use your models in games are 
presented on datasheets. Each unit has a datasheet; 
you will need the datasheets for all the units 
from your army. Y ou can find out more about datasheets on pages 37-38.
KEYWORDS 
All datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords and other keywords. Faction keywords can be used to help you decide which models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same. In either case, keywords appear in Keyword Bold. Keywords are sometimes linked to (or ‘tagged’ by) a rule. For example, a rule might say that it applies to Infantry units. This means it only applies to units that have the Infantry keyword on their datasheet. The pluralisation (or otherwise) of keywords does not affect which units the rule in question applies to. CORE CONCEPTS
This section introduces various rules terms that you will find throughout the Core Rules and beyond. 
These key concepts form the basis of the Warhammer 40,000 rules, and are essential for every kind of battle.

ENGAGEMENT RANGE
Engagement Range represents the zone of threat that models present to their enemies. While a model is within 1" horizontally and 5" vertically of an enemy model, those models – and their units – are within Engagement Range of each other.
Models cannot be set up or end a Normal, Advance or Fall 
Back move within Engagement Range of any enemy models. If for any reason a model cannot meet this condition, that model is destroyed. 
 ■  Engagement Range: Within 1" horizontally and 
5" vertically.
 ■  Models cannot be set up within Engagement Range of 
enemy models.
BATTLEFIELD
Battles of Warhammer 40,000 are fought on rectangular battlefields. This can be any surface upon which the models can stand – a dining table, for example, or the floor. Y our mission will guide you as to the size of battlefield required.
TERRAIN FEATURES
The scenery on a battlefield can be represented by models from the Warhammer 40,000 range. These models are called terrain features to differentiate them from the models that make up an army. Terrain features are set up on the battlefield before the battle begins. Y ou can find out more about terrain features on pages 44-48.
Unless the mission you are playing instructs you otherwise, you 
should feel free to create an exciting battlefield using any terrain features from your collection.
MEASURING DISTANCES
Distances in Warhammer 40,000 are measured in inches ("). Y ou can measure distances whenever you wish.
When measuring the distance between models, measure 
between the closest points of the bases of the models you’re measuring to and from. If a model does not have a base, measure to the closest point of any part of that model instead. 
If a rule says it applies ‘within’ a certain distance, it applies at 
any distance that is not more than the specified distance. For example, within 1" means any distance that is not more than 1" away.Hints and Tips
WOBBLY MODELS
Sometimes you may find that a 
particular terrain feature makes it hard for you to place a model exactly where you want to. If you delicately balance a model in place, it is very likely to fall as soon as someone nudges the table, leaving your painted model damaged or even broken. 
In cases like this, provided it is still physically possible to place the model in the desired location, you may find it helps to leave a model in a safer position, provided both players agree and know its ‘actual’ location. If, later on, an enemy model is shooting the model, you will have to hold it back in place so that visibility can be determined.

DETERMINING VISIBILITY
Warhammer 40,000 uses true line of sight to determine visibility between models. To check this, get a ‘model’s perspective’ view by looking from behind the observing model. For the purposes of determining visibility, an observing model can see through other models in its unit, and a model’s base is also part of that model.
MODEL VISIBLE
If any part of another model can be seen from any part of the observing model, that other model is visible to the observing model. 
UNIT VISIBLE
If one or more models in a unit is visible to the observing model, then that model’s unit is visible to the observing model. 
MODEL FULLY VISIBLE
If every part of another model that is facing the observing model can be seen from any part of the observing model, then that other model is said to be fully visible to the observing model, i.e. the observing model has line of sight to all parts of the other model that are facing it, without any other models or terrain features blocking visibility to any of those parts. 
UNIT FULLY VISIBLE
If every model in a unit is fully visible to an observing model, then that unit is fully visible to that observing model. For the purposes of determining if an enemy unit is fully visible, an observing model can see through other models in the unit it is observing.
 ■ Model Visible: If any part 
of a model can be seen, it is visible.
 ■ Unit Visible: If any model in a unit is visible, that model’s unit is visible.

CORE RULES | CORE CONCEPTSUNIT COHERENCY
A unit that contains more than one model must be set 
up and end any kind of move as a single group, with all of its models within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of at least one other model from that unit. While a unit has seven or more models, all of its models must instead be set up and end any kind of move within 2" horizontally and 5" vertically of at least two other models from that unit. This is called Unit Coherency. 
If for any reason a model cannot be set up in Unit 
Coherency, that model is destroyed. If a unit cannot end a move in Unit Coherency, it cannot make that move and its models are returned to their previous positions.
At the end of every turn, each player must remove 
models, one at a time, from any of the units from their armies that are no longer in Unit Coherency, until only a single group of models from each of those units remains in play and in Unit Coherency. Models removed in this way count as having been destroyed, but they never trigger any rules that apply when a model is destroyed.
 ■ Unit Coherency : Within 2" horizontally and 5" 
vertically of:
 ● One other model from the same unit  
(in units of 2-6 models).
 ● Two other models from the same unit  
(in units of 7+ models).
 ■ At the end of every turn, if a unit is not in Unit 
Coherency, the controlling player must remove models until that unit is in Unit Coherency again.
A  Each model in this Sternguard Veterans 
unit of five models is within 2" of at 
least one other model in the unit. This 
unit is therefore in Unit Coherency.
B Each model in this Termagants unit of 
ten models is within 2" of at least two other models in the unit. This unit is 
therefore also in Unit Coherency.

DICE
In order to fight a battle, you will require some six-sided 
dice (often abbreviated to D6). Some rules refer to 2D6, 3D6 and so on – in such cases, roll that many D6 and add the results together.
If a rule requires you to roll a D3, roll a D6 and halve the result 
(rounding up to a whole number) to get the D3 result, as shown below.
ROLLING A D3
DICE RESULT D3 RESULT
 or 1
 or 2
 or 3
If a rule requires a dice roll of, for example, 3 or more, this is often abbreviated to 3+. Where several consecutive dice results are relevant to a rule, these are often shown as a range (e.g. 1-3).
RE-ROLLS
Some rules allow you to re-roll a dice roll, which means you get to roll some or all of the dice again. If a rule allows you to re-roll a dice roll that was made by adding several dice together (e.g. 2D6, 3D6, etc.) then, unless otherwise stated, you must re-roll all of those dice again. 
Y ou can never re-roll a dice more than once, and re-rolls happen 
before modifiers (if any) are applied. Rules that refer to the value of an ‘unmodified’ dice roll are referring to the dice result after 
any re-rolls, but before any modifiers are applied.
 ■ Unmodified Dice : the result after re-rolls, but before 
any modifiers.
 ■A dice can never be re-rolled more than once.
 ■ You must re-roll all dice if several need adding together 
(e.g. 2D6).
 ■Re-rolls are applied before any modifiers.
ROLL-OFFS
Some rules instruct players to roll off. To do so, both players roll 
one D6, and whoever scores highest wins the roll-off. If there is a tie for the highest roll, roll off again. Neither player is allowed to re-roll or modify any of the D6 when making a roll-off.
SEQUENCING
While playing Warhammer 40,000, you’ll occasionally find that two or more rules are to be resolved at the same time. If this occurs during the battle, the player whose turn it is chooses the order. If this occurs before or after the battle, or at the start or end of a battle round, the players roll off and the winner decides the order in which those rules are resolved.Hints and Tips
DICE ROLLING
In a game of Warhammer 40,000 you 
and your opponent will be rolling, and in some cases re-rolling, lots of dice. It is good practice to always 
make sure your opponent knows what 
you are rolling dice for, and what 
abilities and rules are in effect that 
enable you to make any re-rolls.
Many gamers roll their dice 
somewhere on the battlefield, but some roll their dice elsewhere, such as in a dice tray. Wherever you roll your dice, make sure you roll the dice where your opponent can see the results too. If a dice is rolled out of bounds (i.e. it rolls off your battlefield, out of your dice tray or ends up on the floor), it is very common to ignore the result of that dice and roll it again. Rolling an out-of-bounds dice again doesn’t count as having re-rolled that dice.
If a dice does not lie flat on your 
battlefield after it has been thrown, it is called a cocked dice. Some players use a house rule that unless a dice is flat after it has been rolled, or unless you can balance another dice on top of a cocked dice without it sliding off, it must be rolled again. It is more common for players to roll the dice again only if they can’t be sure of the result. In any case, rolling a cocked dice again doesn’t count as having re-rolled that dice.

2THE BATTLE ROUND
Minute by bloody minute the battle grinds on, from the opening volleys of shots through furious 
offensives and desperate counter-attacks, into the last dying moments when victory hangs by a thread. 
Warhammer 40,000 is played in a series of battle rounds. In each battle round, both players have a turn. The 
same player always takes the first turn in each battle round – the mission you are playing will tell you which player this is. Each turn consists of a series of phases, which must be resolved in the following order.
COMMAND PHASE
Both players muster strategic resources, then you test your units’ battle readiness.
MOVEMENT PHASE
Your units manoeuvre across the battlefield and reinforcements enter the fray.
SHOOTING PHASE
Your units fire their ranged weapons at the foe.
CHARGE PHASE
Your units charge forward to battle at close quarters.
FIGHT PHASE
Both players’ units pile in and attack with melee weapons.
Once a player’s turn has ended, their opponent then starts their turn. Once both players 
have completed a turn, the battle round has been completed and the next one begins, 
and so on, until the battle ends.

51. COMMAND
At the start of your Command phase, before doing anything 
else, both players gain 1CP . Command points are a strategic resource that you can spend during the battle to use Stratagems. Y ou can find out more about Stratagems on pages 41-42.
Then, if you have any other rules that need to be resolved in 
the Command phase, you do so now before progressing to the Battle-shock step.
 ■ Both players gain 1CP .
 ■ Resolve any other rules that occur in the Command phase.
2. BATTLE-SHOCK
In this step, you must take a Battle-shock test for each of your units on the battlefield that is Below Half-strength (pg 12). To do so, roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, the test is passed; otherwise, the test is failed and, until the start of your next Command phase, that unit is Battle-shocked.
While a unit is Battle-shocked:
 ■ The Objective Control characteristic of all of its models is 0.
 ■ If it Falls Back, you must take a Desperate Escape test for 
every model in that unit (pg 14).
 ■Its controlling player cannot use Stratagems to affect that unit. 
Once you have taken Battle-shock tests for all of your units that 
require them, your Command phase ends and you progress to your Movement phase.
 ■ T ake a Battle-shock test for each unit from your army on 
the battlefield that is Below Half-strength.
 ■ Roll 2D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the unit’s 
Leadership, the test is passed. Otherwise, the unit is Battle-shocked until the start of your next Command phase.
 ■ Battle-shocked units have an OC of 0 and their controlling 
player cannot use Stratagems to affect them.
 ■ Battle-shocked units must take Desperate Escape tests if 
they Fall Back.COMMAND PHASE
Commanders gauge the flow of the battle, consolidating their objectives before making alterations to 
their battle plans and devising new tactics and strategies with which to defeat the foe. 
Y our Command phase is split into 
two steps. In the first, both players gain 1 Command point (CP) and you resolve any other Command phase rules; in the second, you test to see if any of your units are Battle-shocked.

STARTING STRENGTH
The number of models a unit contains when it is added 
to your army is known as its Starting Strength. 
BELOW HALF-STRENGTH
Some rules will refer to a unit being Below Half-strength. 
 ■ If a unit has a Starting Strength of 1, then it is said 
to be Below Half-strength while its remaining number of wounds is less than half of its Wounds characteristic. 
 ■ For any other unit, while the number of models in 
that unit is less than half of its Starting Strength, that unit is said to be Below Half-strength.
DESTROYED
Throughout a battle, models will suffer damage and be destroyed. When a model is destroyed, it is removed from the battlefield. When every model in a unit has been destroyed, that unit is destroyed.ATTACHED UNITS
Some  Character units have the Leader ability (pg 39), 
which lets them merge with other units (known as Bodyguard units) to form an Attached unit. 
The Starting Strength of an Attached unit is equal to 
the combined Starting Strengths of all of its units (i.e. the number of models in the Leader unit added to the number of models in the Bodyguard unit). If either the Leader unit or the Bodyguard unit in an Attached unit 
is destroyed, the Starting Strength of the remaining unit 
is changed to be equal to its original Starting Strength.
Example:  A Primaris Captain (Starting Strength 1) is 
attached to a unit of Intercessors (Starting Strength 5). This Attached unit has a Starting Strength of 6. If all the Intercessors are destroyed, the remaining Primaris Captain would revert to having a Starting Strength of 1. 
For the purposes of rules that are triggered when a unit is destroyed, such rules are still triggered when one of the individual units that made up an Attached unit is destroyed (the Leader or the Bodyguard unit).
Example: If a rule awards you with 1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and you target an Attached 
unit, you would gain 1VP if the Bodyguard unit is 
destroyed and 1VP if the Leader unit is destroyed (for a total of 2VP).

1. MOVE UNITS
Start your Movement phase by selecting one unit from your 
army that is on the battlefield to move: 
 ■ Unless that unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy 
models, it can make a Normal move, or Advance, or Remain Stationary. 
 ■ If that unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy 
models, it can either Remain Stationary or Fall Back. 
After you have finished moving that unit, select another unit from your army to move, and so on, until you have done so with all of your units. Once you have moved all of your units, progress to the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase.
Each time you move a unit, you can move any of its models you 
choose to. The controlling player chooses the order in which to 
move their models. Whenever you move a model, you can pivot 
it and/or change its position on the battlefield along any path, but no part of its base can be moved across an enemy model or cross the edge of the battlefield. It can be moved over friendly models as if they were not there if you wish, but it cannot end its move on top of another model. The only exception to this is when moving Monster or Vehicle models; such models cannot be moved over other friendly Monster or Vehicle models and must be moved around them instead. The distance a model moves is measured using the part of its base that moves furthest along its path. If a model does not have a base, measure using whichever part of that model moves the furthest. 
 ■  When a unit moves it can make a Normal move, Advance or 
Remain Stationary.
 ■ Units that are within Engagement Range of any enemy 
models can only Fall Back or Remain Stationary.
REMAIN STATIONARY
If a unit Remains Stationary, none of its models can be moved for the rest of the phase.
NORMAL MOVES
When a unit makes a Normal move, each model in that unit can move a distance in inches less than or equal to its Move (M) characteristic, but no model can be moved within Engagement Range of any enemy models (pg 7).
 ■ Normal Move: Models move up to M".
 ■ Cannot move within Engagement Range of any 
enemy models.MOVEMENT PHASE 
The ground shakes to the tread of marching feet and the growl of engines as armies advance across the 
battlefield and vie for advantageous positions.
Y our Movement phase is split 
into two steps. First you can move your units, then you can set up reinforcements.

ADVANCE MOVES
When a unit Advances, make an Advance roll for that unit 
by rolling one D6. Add the result in inches to the Move characteristic of each model in that unit until the end of the phase. Each model in that unit can then make an Advance move by moving a distance in inches less than or equal to this total, but no model can be moved within Engagement Range of enemy models. A unit cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same turn that it Advanced.
 ■Advance Move: Models move up to M+D6".
 ■ Cannot move within Engagement Range of any 
enemy models.
 ■ Units that Advance cannot shoot or charge this turn.
FALL BACK MOVES
When a unit Falls Back, each model in that unit can make a Fall Back move by moving a distance in inches less than or equal to its Move characteristic, and when doing so you can move it within Engagement Range of enemy models, provided it does not end that move within Engagement Range of any enemy models – if this is not possible, that unit cannot Fall Back.
A unit cannot shoot or declare a charge in the same 
turn that it Fell Back.
Desperate Escape Tests
Unlike when making other types of move, models can 
move over enemy models when making a Fall Back move as if those enemy models were not there, but you must take a Desperate Escape test for each model that will do so (excluding models that are Titanic or can Fly ) 
before any models in that unit are moved. In addition, if a unit is Battle-shocked when it is selected to Fall Back, you must take a Desperate Escape test for every model in that unit before any are moved.Each time you take a Desperate Escape test for a model, roll one D6. For each roll of 1-2, one model from the unit that is Falling Back is destroyed (selected by you). The same model can only ever trigger one Desperate 
Escape test per phase.
 ■Fall Back Move: Models move up to M".
 ■ Units that Fall Back cannot shoot or declare a 
charge in the same turn.
 ■ Models can move over enemy models when Falling 
Back, but you must take Desperate Escape tests 
for them before they do so (excluding models that are Titanic or can Fly ).
 ■ If a Battle-shocked unit is selected to Fall Back, 
take a Desperate Escape test for every model in that unit.
 ■ Desperate Escape Test: Roll one D6. On a 1-2, one model from that unit is destroyed.
CORE RULES | MOVEMENT PHASE
A  The Sternguard Veterans are selected to 
make a Fall Back move, but to do so 
they must move through enemy 
models, so Desperate Escape tests  
are required.
B The controlling player rolls one D6 for 
each model that moves through an 
enemy unit, resulting in a 1, 2, 4, 4 and 
6. Two models are therefore destroyed.

CORE RULES | MOVEMENT PHASEMOVING OVER TERRAIN
Warhammer 40,000 battlefields are strewn with a 
wide variety of obstacles, structures and detritus collectively known as terrain features (see pages 44-48). When a model makes any kind of move, it can be moved over a terrain feature but not through it (so models can’t move through a wall, for example, but can climb up or over it). 
A model can be moved over terrain features that 
are 2" or less in height as if they were not there. 
A model can be moved vertically in order to climb up or down any terrain features that are taller than this, counting the vertical distance up and/or down as part of its move. Models cannot end any kind of move mid-climb – if it is not possible to end the move as a result, that move cannot be made.
 ■ Models can move freely over terrain 
features 2" or less in height.
 ■ Models cannot move through terrain 
features taller than 2", but can climb up and down them.
FLYING
If a model can Fly , then when it makes a Normal, Advance or 
Fall Back move, it can be moved over enemy models as if they were not there, and can be moved within Engagement Range of enemy models when making such a move. Note this also means that Monster and Vehicle models that can Fly  can be moved 
over other Monster and Vehicle models when making such a move. However, models that can Fly  cannot end their move on 
top of any other models or within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
When a model that can Fly  starts or ends a move on a terrain 
feature, instead of measuring the path it has moved across the 
battlefield, you instead measure its path ‘through the air’ , as shown in the diagram below.
In this example the Tyranid Prime makes a 
Normal move of 12" to end on top of the ruin. 
Because it can Fly  it can move directly over the 
enemy Terminators as if they were not there, and it is the diagonal distance through the air 
that is measured.

Leaper Advances

It moves a total of 9",

than 2" so the vertical 
distance of 3" must 
be counted as part of 
the move.

2. REINFORCEMENTS
Some units have a rule that allows them to start the battle in 
Reserves, such as Deep Strike (pg 39). Such units will arrive later in the battle and are known as Reserves units. Any Reserves units that have not been set up on the battlefield when the battle ends count as having been destroyed.
In the Reinforcements step of your Movement phase, if you have 
any Reserves units in your army, you can select one or more of them and set them up on the battlefield, one at a time. Once all 
your Reserves units that you wish to set up this turn have been 
set up, your Movement phase ends and you progress to your Shooting phase. 
Details of how to set up Reserves units are described in the 
same rules that enabled the unit to be set up in Reserves. These rules will typically specify a distance away from all enemy models; whenever such a distance is specified, it always applies to the horizontal distance, even though normally you measure to and from the closest part of a model’s base. 
Reserves units always count as having made a 
Normal move in the turn they are set up on the battlefield, and so cannot move further during this phase. Otherwise, units set up in this way can act normally this turn (shoot, declare a 
charge, fight, etc.).
 ■ Reserves Unit:  A unit that starts 
the battle in a location other than 
the battlefield.
 ■ Always count as having made a 
Normal move in the turn they are set up on the battlefield.
 ■ Any specified distance from 
enemy models applies to horizontal distance.
 ■ Any Reserves unit not set up on the 
battlefield by the end of the battle counts as destroyed.
CORE RULES | MOVEMENT PHASE

TRANSPORTS
Some units can carry others across the battlefield, providing their passengers with greater speed and protection as 
they are ferried to the front lines or towards vital objectives.
Some models have the Transport keyword. The 
following rules describe how units can embark within and disembark from such models, and how they are used to move these passengers across the battlefield. 
TRANSPORT CAPACITY 
All Transport models have a transport capacity 
listed on their datasheet. This determines the type and maximum number of friendly models that can embark within them.
Units can start the battle embarked within a 
Transport model instead of being set up separately – declare which units are embarked within a Transport model before you set it up.
EMBARK
If a unit makes a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move, and every model in that unit ends that move within 3" of a friendly Transport model, they can embark within it. A unit cannot embark if it has already disembarked from a Transport model in the same phase. Remove the unit from the battlefield and place it to one side – it is now embarked within that Transport model. Unless otherwise stated, units cannot do anything or be affected in any way while 
they are embarked. ■ A unit can embark within a friendly Transport 
if all of its models end a Normal, Advance or 
Fall Back move within 3" of that Transport.
 ■ A unit cannot embark and disembark in the 
same phase.
DISEMBARK 
If a unit from your army starts your Movement phase embarked within a Transport model, that unit can disembark in that phase. 
When a unit disembarks from a Transport model, 
set it up on the battlefield so that it is wholly within 3" of that Transport model and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models. If, for any reason, a disembarking model cannot be set up, that 
model’s unit cannot disembark. 
Units that disembark from a Transport model that 
either Remained Stationary this phase or has not yet made a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move this phase can then act normally (make a Normal move, Advance, shoot, declare a charge, fight, etc.) in the remainder of the turn. Such a disembarking unit cannot choose to Remain Stationary.
Units that disembark from a Transport model that 
made a Normal move this phase count as having made a Normal move themselves; they cannot move further during this phase. Such a unit also cannot declare a charge in the same turn, but can otherwise act normally in the remainder of the turn. 
Units cannot disembark from a Transport model 
that either Advanced or Fell Back this turn.
 ■ Units that start your Movement phase 
embarked within a Transport can disembark this phase, provided their Transport has not Advanced or Fallen Back.
 ■ If a unit disembarks before its Transport 
moves, it can act normally.
 ■ If a unit disembarks after its Transport 
moves, it cannot move or charge this turn, but can otherwise act normally.
 ■ Disembarking units must be set up wholly 
within 3" of their Transport and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models (or the unit cannot disembark).
 ■ Units that disembark this turn cannot 
Remain Stationary.
CORE RULES | TRANSPORTSFIRING DECK
Some transports have firing hatches, ports or platforms from which embarked passengers can shoot.
Some Transport models have ‘Firing Deck x’ 
listed in their abilities. Each time such a model is selected to shoot in the Shooting phase, you can select up to ‘x’ models embarked within it. Then, for each of those embarked models, you 
can select one ranged weapon that embarked 
model is equipped with. Until that Transport model has resolved all of its attacks, it counts as being equipped with all of the weapons you selected in this way, in addition to its other weapons.
 ■ Firing Deck ‘ x’: Each time this Transport 
shoots, select one weapon from up to ‘x’ models embarked within it; this 
Transport counts as being equipped with those weapons as well.
17
DESTROYED TRANSPORTS
If a Transport model is destroyed, any units 
embarked within that Transport model must immediately disembark (see opposite) before that Transport model is removed from the battlefield.
Units that disembark from a destroyed Transport 
model are not affected by that model’s Deadly Demise ability (pg 23). Instead, you must roll one D6 for each disembarking model. For each roll of 1, that 
disembarking model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound 
(pg 23). In addition, if a unit disembarks from a destroyed Transport model:
 ■  Until the start of its controlling player’s next 
Command phase, that unit is Battle-shocked.
 ■ Until the end of the turn, that unit counts as 
having made a Normal move this turn, and cannot declare a charge this turn (pg 29). 
 ■ If a Transport is destroyed, any embarked 
units must disembark.
 ■ Roll one D6 for each model that disembarks: 
for each 1, that model’s unit suffers 1 mortal wound.
 ■ Until the start of its controlling player’s next 
Command phase, the disembarking unit is Battle-shocked.
 ■ Until the end of the turn, the disembarking unit 
counts as having made a Normal move, and cannot declare a charge.
Emergency Disembarkation
If a Transport model is destroyed and it is not possible to set up a disembarking unit wholly within 3" of that Transport model and not within Engagement Range of any enemy models, that unit must instead perform an Emergency Disembarkation. This is performed as described for disembarking from a destroyed Transport model, except that a unit that does so must be set up wholly within 6" of the destroyed Transport model (instead 
of wholly within 3") and not within Engagement 
Range of any enemy models, and when rolling for each disembarking model, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound for each roll of 1-3 (instead of for each roll of 1). If, for any reason, a disembarking model still cannot be set up, that model is destroyed.
 ■ Units disembarking a destroyed Transport 
that cannot be set up wholly within 3" of it must perform an Emergency Disembarkation:
 ● Must be set up wholly within 6" of it 
instead of wholly within 3".
 ● Suffer 1 mortal wound for each roll of 1-3, 
instead of each roll of 1.
 ● Any disembarking model that cannot be 
set up is destroyed.

5In your Shooting phase, if you have one or more eligible units 
from your army on the battlefield, you can select those units, one at a time, and shoot with them. Each unit can only be selected to shoot once per phase. Once all of the units you selected have shot, progress to your Charge phase. 
A unit is eligible to shoot unless any of the following apply:
 ■That unit Advanced this turn.
 ■ That unit Fell Back this turn.
SELECT TARGETS
Each time a unit shoots, before any attacks are resolved, you 
must select the enemy units that will be the targets for all of the ranged weapons you wish its models to make attacks with. Each time you select a target for a model’s ranged weapon, you can only select an enemy unit as the target if at least one model in that unit is both within range of that weapon and visible to that attacking model (pg 8). An enemy model is within range of a weapon if the distance between it and the attacking model is equal to or less than that weapon’s Range characteristic. 
If a model has more than one ranged weapon, it can shoot all 
of them at the same target or it can shoot each of them at a different target, but it cannot split attacks from the same weapon across more than one target. Similarly, if a unit has more than one model, those models can shoot at the same or different targets. In any case, when you select a target unit you must declare which models will target that unit with which weapons before any attacks are resolved. If any of these weapons have more than one profile that you must choose between, you must also declare which profile is being used.
 ■ Before a unit shoots, select the targets for all of its 
ranged weapons.
 ■ At least one model in the target unit must be visible to 
the attacking model and within range of the weapon being used.
 ■ Models with more than one ranged weapon can shoot 
them at the same or different targets, but models cannot split attacks from the same weapon across more than one target.
 ■ Models in the same unit can shoot at the same or 
different targets.SHOOTING PHASE

5MAKE RANGED ATTACKS
The shooting unit’s models now make attacks using their ranged 
weapons. Each time a model shoots with a ranged weapon, it will make a number of attacks equal to the Attacks (A) characteristic in that weapon’s profile. Y ou make one Hit roll for each attack being made (see Making Attacks, pages 21-23).
If you selected more than one target for your unit to shoot at, 
you must resolve all of the attacks against one target before moving on to the next target. If your unit is shooting more than 
one ranged weapon at a target, and those weapons have different 
profiles, then after you have resolved attacks with one of those weapons you must, if any other weapons with the same profile are also being shot at that unit, resolve those attacks before resolving any other attacks against the target.
Note that, provided at least one model in the target unit was 
visible to an attacking model and in range of that attacking model’s weapon when that target unit was selected, that weapon’s attacks can still be made, even if no models in the target unit remain visible to or in range of it when you come to resolve those attacks (for example, because models in the target unit have already been destroyed by attacks made with other weapons in the attacking model’s unit). 
 ■ When a model shoots a weapon, it makes a number of 
attacks equal to that weapon’s Attacks characteristic.
 ■ Resolve all attacks against one unit before resolving 
attacks against any other unit.
 ■ Resolve all attacks made with the same weapon profile 
before resolving attacks with any other profile.
 ■ If a weapon was in range and its target was visible when 
selected, that weapon’s attacks can always be made.
Locked in Combat
A unit is not eligible to shoot while it is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. 
While an enemy unit is within Engagement Rage of one or more 
units from your army, you cannot select that enemy unit as a target of ranged weapons.
Monster and Vehicle units are exceptions to these rules, as 
described in the Big Guns Never Tire section (see right).
 ■ Units cannot shoot while within Engagement Range of 
enemy units. 
 ■ Units cannot shoot at targets within Engagement Range of 
friendly units.
CORE RULES | SHOOTING PHASEBIG GUNS NEVER TIRE
Monsters and war engines can dispense death from afar even as they trample the masses before them. 
Monster and Vehicle units are 
eligible to shoot in their controlling player’s Shooting phase even while they are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. Ranged 
weapons equipped by Monster 
and Vehicle units can target one or more of the enemy units they are within Engagement Range of, even if other friendly units are also within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit. Each time a Monster or Vehicle model makes a ranged attack, if its unit was within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units when it selected its targets, unless that attack is made with a Pistol (pg 25), subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.
Y ou can select an enemy Monster 
or Vehicle unit within Engagement 
Range of one or more units from 
your army as a target of ranged weapons. Each time a model from your army makes a ranged attack against such a target, unless that attack is made with a Pistol, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.
Designer’s Note: A unit that is 
within Engagement Range of an enemy Monster or Vehicle unit is still not eligible to shoot, and so cannot make ranged attacks against that Monster or Vehicle unit (unless that unit is eligible to shoot even while within Engagement Range of enemy units, e.g. it is itself a Monster 
or Vehicle unit, or its models are 
equipped with Pistols). Other units from your army that are eligible to shoot can, however, target and shoot that enemy Monster or Vehicle unit.
 ■ Monsters  and Vehicles  
can shoot, and be shot at, even while they are within Engagement Range of enemy units. Each time a ranged attack is made by or against such a unit, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll (unless shooting with a Pistol).STEALTH

If every model in a unit has this ability, then each time 
a ranged attack is made against it, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll.

41. HIT ROLL
When a model makes an attack, make one Hit roll for that 
attack by rolling one D6. If the result of the Hit roll is greater than or equal to the attack’s Ballistic Skill (BS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a ranged weapon) or its Weapon Skill (WS) characteristic (if the attack is being made with a melee weapon), then that Hit roll is successful and scores one hit against the target unit. Otherwise, the attack fails and the attack sequence ends. 
An unmodified Hit roll of 6 is called a Critical Hit and is always 
successful. An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails. A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
 ■ Hit Roll (Ranged Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s BS.
 ■ Hit Roll (Melee Attack): A hit is scored if the D6 result equals or exceeds that attack’s WS.
 ■ Critical Hit:  Unmodified Hit roll of 6. Always successful.
 ■An unmodified Hit roll of 1 always fails.
 ■ A Hit roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
2. WOUND ROLL
Each time an attack scores a hit against a target unit, make a Wound roll for that attack by rolling one D6 to see if that attack successfully wounds the target unit. The result required is determined by comparing the attack’s Strength (S) characteristic with the target’s Toughness (T) characteristic, as shown below.

 ■ Critical Wound : Unmodified Wound roll of 6. 
Always successful.
 ■An unmodified Wound roll of 1 always fails.
 ■ A Wound roll can never be modified by more than -1 or +1.
3. ALLOCATE ATTACK
If an attack successfully wounds the target unit, the player controlling the target unit allocates that attack to one model in the target unit, as follows.
If a model in the target unit has already lost one or more 
wounds, or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase, that attack must be allocated to that model. Otherwise, that attack can be allocated to any model in the target unit. Note that it does not matter if that model is visible to or within 
range/Engagement Range of the attacking model.
 ■ If a model in the target unit has already lost any wounds or 
had other attacks allocated to it this phase, the attack must 
be allocated to that model. 
4. SAVING THROW
The player controlling the target unit then makes one saving throw. By default, this will be an armour saving throw using their model’s Save (Sv) characteristic, but some models have invulnerable saves that can be used instead (see right). To make an armour saving throw, roll one D6, then modify the result by the Armour Penetration (AP) characteristic of the attack. For example, if the attack has an AP of -1, then 1 is subtracted from the saving throw.
If the result is greater than or equal to the Save characteristic of 
the model the attack was allocated to, then that saving throw is successful and the attack sequence ends. Otherwise, that saving throw fails and that model suffers damage (pg 23).
An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails. A saving throw 
can never be improved by more than +1. 
 ■ Saving Throw: Roll one D6 and modify by the attack’s AP . If the result is less than the Save of the model being rolled for, the saving throw is failed and that model suffers damage. Otherwise, that attack is saved.
 ■An unmodified saving throw of 1 always fails.
 ■A saving throw can never be improved by more than +1.INVULNERABLE SAVES
Whether shielded by force fields, enveloped in mystical energies or simply possessed of preternatural senses and lightning-fast reflexes, some warriors are protected by more than mere physical armour. 
Some models have an invulnerable 
save listed on their datasheet. Each 
time an attack is allocated to a 
model with an invulnerable save, the controlling player must choose to use either that model’s Save characteristic or its invulnerable save, but not both. If a model has more than one invulnerable save, it can only use one of them – choose which it will use.
Unlike armour saving throws (which 
use a model’s Save characteristic), invulnerable saving throws are never modified by an attack’s Armour Penetration characteristic, but otherwise follow the normal rules for saving throws.
 ■ Invulnerable Save: Never modified by an attack’s AP .
 ■ The controlling player can 
choose to use either a model’s invulnerable save or its Save characteristic.

45. INFLICT DAMAGE
The damage inflicted is equal to the Damage (D) characteristic 
of the attack. A model loses one wound for each point of damage it suffers. If a model’s wounds are reduced to 0 or less, it is destroyed and removed from play. If a model loses several wounds from an attack and is destroyed, any excess damage inflicted by that attack is lost and has no effect.
 ■ A model loses a number of wounds equal to the attack’s 
Damage characteristic.
 ■ If a model is destroyed by an attack, any excess damage 
inflicted by that attack is lost.MORTAL WOUNDS
Some attacks are so powerful that no armour or force field can withstand their fury. 
Some attacks inflict mortal wounds. 
Each mortal wound inflicts one point of damage on the target unit, and they are always applied one at a time. Do not make a Wound 
roll or saving throw (including 
invulnerable saving throws) against a mortal wound – just allocate it as you would any other attack and inflict damage to a model in the target unit as described on the right.
Unlike damage inflicted by normal 
attacks, excess damage from mortal wounds is not lost if the damage can be allocated to another model. Instead, keep allocating damage to another model in the target unit until either all the damage has been allocated or the target unit is destroyed. 
If, when a unit is selected to shoot or 
fight, one or more of its attacks can inflict mortal wounds on the target, resolve any normal damage inflicted by the attacking unit’s attacks on that target before inflicting any mortal wounds on that target. If an attack inflicts mortal wounds in addition to any normal damage, but the normal damage is subsequently saved, the target unit still suffers those mortal wounds, as described above.
 ■ Each mortal wound inflicted 
on a unit causes one model in that unit to lose one wound.
 ■ No saving throws can be 
made against mortal wounds.
 ■ Mortal wounds inflicted by 
attacks always apply after any normal damage, even if that damage was saved.
CORE RULES | MAKING ATTACKSFEEL NO PAIN
Some warriors refuse to be laid low, even by what should be fatal wounds.
Some models have ‘Feel No Pain x+’ listed in their abilities. 
Each time a model with this ability suffers damage and so would lose a wound (including wounds lost due to mortal wounds), roll one D6: if the result is greater than or equal to the number denoted by ‘x’ , that wound is ignored and is not lost. If a model has more than one Feel No Pain ability, 
you can only use one of those abilities each time that model 
suffers damage and so would lose a wound. 
 ■ Feel No Pain x+: Each time this model would lose a wound, roll one D6: if the result equals or exceeds ‘x’, that wound is not lost.
DEADLY DEMISE
From detonating ammo stores to corrosive innards or frenzied death throes, some targets are deadly even in defeat.
Some models have ‘Deadly Demise x’ listed in their 
abilities. When such a model is destroyed, roll one D6 before removing it from play (if such a model is a Transport, roll before any embarked models disembark). On a 6, each unit within 6" of that model suffers a number of mortal wounds denoted by ‘x’ (if this is a random 
number, roll separately for each unit within 6").
Example:  A Transport model with the Deadly Demise D3 
ability is destroyed. Before any models disembark and 
before removing it from play, its controlling player rolls one D6, getting a 6. There are three units within 6" of that destroyed model, so its controlling player rolls one D3 for each of them, inflicting mortal wounds accordingly. 
 ■ Deadly Demise x: When this model is destroyed, 
roll one D6. On a 6, each unit within 6" suffers ‘x’ mortal wounds.

1 A unit of 20 Termagants targets a Terminators unit with their Fleshborers. 
As these weapons all have the same profile, the controlling player 
chooses to use the fast dice rolling method. 
2 Each has an Attacks characteristic of 1, so the controlling player rolls 
twenty D6. Seven of the results are greater than or equal to the 
Fleshborers’ Ballistic Skill of 4+, so seven hits are scored, and seven 
Wound rolls are then made. 
3 The Strength characteristic of those attacks is 5, which is equal to the 
Toughness of a Terminator, so rolls of 4+ are required to successfully 
wound the target. Of those seven rolls, five successfully wound. 
4 As all the attacks have a Damage characteristic of 1, and as the saving 
throws required for the Terminators are all the same, the Space Marines player can continue to use the fast dice rolling method and make all of 
those saving throws at the same time, even though strictly you should 
allocate attacks beforehand. 
5 The attacks all have an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1, so in this 
instance, even though the Terminators have an invulnerable saving throw, their normal Save characteristic will afford them a better chance of 
survival. The saving throws rolled result in a 1, 2, 4, 5 and 5, meaning that 
two are failed.
6 The Space Marines player now has to allocate those two attacks, one at a time. One Terminator model has already lost two wounds earlier in the 
battle, so they must allocate attacks to that model first. This means that 
model loses its last remaining wound (Terminator models have a Wounds 
characteristic of 3), and is destroyed. The last attack is allocated to a 
different model, and so that model suffers one wound. Hints and Tips
FAST DICE ROLLING
The rules for making attacks have been 
written assuming you will resolve them one at a time. However, it is possible to speed up your battles by rolling the dice for similar attacks together. In order to make several attacks at once, all of the attacks must have the same Ballistic Skill (if it’s a ranged attack) or the same Weapon Skill (if it’s a melee attack). They 
must also have the same Strength and 
Armour Penetration characteristics, they must inflict the same Damage, they must be affected by the same abilities, and they must be directed at the same unit. If this is the case, make all of the Hit rolls at the same time, then all of the Wound rolls. Your opponent can then allocate the attacks one at a time, making the saving throws and suffering damage each time as appropriate.
Note that if all the models in the target 
unit would require the same saving throw against the attacks, and the order in which the attacks are allocated would make no difference, then your opponent can make 
all their saving throws at the same time, 
and can do so as soon as the Wound rolls have been made. If they do, they then allocate the attacks that resulted in failed saving throws one at a time, inflicting the damage as appropriate even though, strictly speaking, saving throws should be made after attacks have been allocated. In any case, remember that if the target unit contains a model that has already lost any wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase, the controlling player must allocate further attacks to that model until either it is destroyed, or all the attacks have been saved or resolved.
If the attacks being allocated to a target 
inflict random damage, you cannot use 
the fast dice rolling approach exactly as stated above – you will need to roll the dice one at a time. Consider several attacks with a Damage characteristic of D3 being allocated to a target containing models with two wounds each. As excess damage is lost each time a model is destroyed, the order in which the attacks are allocated and resolved becomes important. If the results of those D3s were 1, then 2, then 3, the attacks would result in a total of two destroyed models, but applying them in the order 3, then 2, then 1 would result in two models being destroyed and a third being damaged with only one wound remaining. As such, the rolls should be made one at 
a time.
CORE RULES | MAKING ATTACKS
24
ASSAULT
Assault weapons fire so indiscriminately that they can 
be shot from the hip as warriors dash forward.
Weapons with [ASSAULT]  in their profile are known as 
Assault weapons. If a unit that Advanced this turn 
contains any models equipped with Assault weapons, it is still eligible to shoot in this turn’s Shooting phase. When such a unit is selected to shoot, you can only resolve attacks using Assault weapons its models are equipped with. 
 ■Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit Advanced.
RAPID FIRE
Rapid fire weapons are capable of long-ranged precision shots or controlled bursts at nearby targets.
Weapons with 
[RAPID FIRE X]  in their profile are known 
as Rapid Fire weapons. Each time such a weapon 
targets a unit within half that weapon’s range, the Attacks characteristic of that weapon is increased by the amount denoted by ‘x’.  
Example:  A model targets a unit that is within half 
range of a weapon with an Attacks characteristic of 1 and the 
[RAPID FIRE 1]  ability. That weapon 
therefore makes two attacks at the target, and you make two Hit rolls.
 ■ [RAPID FIRE X] : Increase the Attacks by ‘x’ when 
targeting units within half range.
IGNORES COVER
Some weapons are designed to root enemy formations out of entrenched positions.
Weapons with 
[IGNORES COVER]  in their profile are 
known as Ignores Cover weapons. Each time an 
attack is made with such a weapon, the target cannot have the Benefit of Cover against that attack (pg 44).
TWIN-LINKED
Dual weapons are often grafted to the same targeting system for greater lethality.
Weapons with 
[TWIN-LINKED]  in their profile are known 
as Twin-linked weapons. Each time an attack is 
made with such a weapon, you can re-roll that attack’s Wound roll.PISTOL
Pistols can be wielded even at point-blank range.
Weapons with [PISTOL]  in their profile are known as 
Pistols. If a unit contains any models equipped with 
Pistols, that unit is eligible to shoot in its controlling player’s Shooting phase even while it is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units. When such a unit is selected to shoot, it can only resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target one of the enemy units it is within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target 
an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within 
Engagement Range of the same enemy unit. 
If a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, 
unless it is a Monster or Vehicle model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets.
 ■ Can be shot even if the bearer’s unit is within 
Engagement Range of enemy units, but must target one of those enemy units.
 ■ Cannot be shot alongside any other non-Pistol 
weapon (except by a Monster or Vehicle).
TORRENT
Torrent weapons shoot clouds of fire, gas or other lethal substances that few foes can hope to evade.
Weapons with 
[TORRENT]  in their profile are known 
as Torrent weapons. Each time an attack is made 
with such a weapon, that attack automatically hits the target.
LETHAL HITS
Some weapons can inflict fatal injuries on any foe, no matter their resilience.
Weapons with 
[LETHAL HITS]  in their profile are known 
as Lethal Hits weapons. Each time an attack is made 
with such a weapon, a Critical Hit automatically wounds the target.
LANCE
Lance weapons are deadly on the charge.
Weapons with [LANCE]  in their profile are known as 
Lance weapons. Each time an attack is made with 
such a weapon, if the bearer made a Charge move this turn, add 1 to that attack’s Wound roll.WEAPON ABILITIES
Some weapons have additional abilities in their profiles. Often these are unique to those weapons and 
are written out in full, but others are common to many weapons, and may only be referenced by name on a weapon’s profile. Some notable examples of these common abilities are defined here; further weapon abilities may be found in other locations such as Codexes.
CORE RULES | WEAPON ABILITIES

INDIRECT FIRE
Indirect fire weapons launch munitions over or around 
intervening obstacles – nowhere is safe from their fury.
Weapons with [INDIRECT FIRE]  in their profile are 
known as Indirect Fire weapons, and attacks can be 
made with them even if the target is not visible to the attacking model. These attacks can destroy enemy models in a target unit even though none may have been visible to the attacking unit when you selected that target.
If no models in a target unit are visible to the 
attacking unit when you select that target, then each 
time a model in the attacking unit makes an attack against that target using an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack (pg 44). 
Example: An enemy unit is targeted by an attacking model equipped with a weapon with the 
[INDIRECT FIRE]  ability. No models in the target unit 
are visible to the attacking model, so when resolving the attacks made with that weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll and each time an attack is allocated to a model in the target unit, it has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
 ■ Can target and make attacks against units that are not visible to the attacking unit.
 ■ If no models are visible in a target unit when 
it is selected, then when making an attack against that target with an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.
PRECISION
Precision attacks can pick high-value targets out in a crowd, whether through the unerring aim of a sniper or the pinpoint accuracy of a blade-master’s strike. 
Weapons with 
[PRECISION]  in their profile are known 
as Precision weapons. Each time an attack made with 
such a weapon successfully wounds an Attached unit (pg 39), if a Character model in that unit is visible to the attacking model, the attacking model’s player can choose to have that attack allocated to that Character model instead of following the normal attack sequence.
 ■ When targeting an Attached unit, the attacking model’s player can have the attack allocated to a Character model in that unit visible to the bearer. BLAST 
High-explosives can fell several warriors in a single blast, but firing them where your comrades will get caught in the ensuing detonation is simply unwise.
Weapons with 
[BLAST]  in their profile are known as 
Blast weapons, and they make a random number of 
attacks. Each time you determine how many attacks are made with a Blast weapon, add 1 to the result for every five models that were in the target unit when you selected it as the target (rounding down). Blast weapons can never be used to make attacks against a unit that is within Engagement Range of one or more units from the attacking model’s army (including its 
own unit). 
Example:  If a weapon with the 
[BLAST]  ability and 
an Attacks characteristic of 2D6 targets a unit that 
contains 11 models, and the roll to determine how many attacks are made is a 9, a total of 11 attacks would be made against that unit.
 ■ Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic for every 
five models in the target unit (rounding down).
 ■ Can never be used against a target that is within Engagement Range of any units from the attacking model’s army (including its own).
MELTA
Melta weapons are powerful heat rays whose fury is magnified at close range.
Weapons with 
[MELTA X]  in their profile are known 
as Melta weapons. Each time an attack made 
with such a weapon targets a unit within half that weapon’s range, that attack’s Damage characteristic is increased by the amount denoted by ‘x’.  
Example:  A model targets a unit that is within half 
range of a weapon with a Damage characteristic of D6 and the 
[MELTA 2]  ability. If that attack inflicts 
damage on the target, it inflicts D6+2 damage.
 ■ [MELTA X] : Increase the Damage by ‘x’ when 
targeting units within half range.
HEAVY
Heavy weapons are amongst the biggest guns on the battlefield, but require bracing to fire at full effect and are unwieldy to bring to bear at close quarters. 
Weapons with 
[HEAVY]  in their profile are known 
as Heavy weapons. Each time an attack is made 
with such a weapon, if the attacking model’s unit Remained Stationary this turn, add 1 to that attack’s Hit roll.
 ■ Add 1 to Hit rolls if the bearer’s unit Remained 
Stationary this turn.

 HAZARDOUS
Weapons powered by unstable and dangerous energy 
sources pose a substantial risk to the wielder every time they are used. 
Weapons with 
[HAZARDOUS]  in their profile are known 
as Hazardous weapons. Each time a unit is selected 
to shoot or fight, if one or more models attack with Hazardous weapons, then after that unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must take one Hazardous test for each Hazardous weapon that was just used by rolling one D6. For each roll of 1, that test is failed and one model in that unit equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (selected by the 
controlling player), unless that model is a Character, 
Monster or Vehicle, in which case it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead. Note that if you selected a Character model in an Attached unit, the mortal wounds suffered must be allocated to that model first, even if there is another model in that unit that has lost one or more wounds or has had attacks allocated to it this phase. 
Example:  A unit of five models make five attacks 
with ranged weapons with the 
[HAZARDOUS]  ability. 
After the unit has finished shooting, its controlling player rolls five D6. One of the results is a 1, and as no models in the unit are Characters, Monsters or Vehicles, one of those models is destroyed.
 ■ After a unit shoots or fights, roll one Hazardous test (one D6) for each Hazardous weapon used. For each 1, one model equipped with a Hazardous weapon is destroyed (Characters, Monsters and Vehicles suffer 3 mortal wounds instead). 
DEVASTATING WOUNDS
Some weapons can inflict strikes of such power that they make a mockery of armour and can cleave through several foes. 
Weapons with 
[DEVASTATING WOUNDS]  in their profile 
are known as Devastating Wounds weapons. Each 
time an attack is made with such a weapon, a Critical Wound inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that weapon and the attack sequence ends.
Example:  An attack made with a Devastating 
Wounds weapon with a Damage characteristic of 
2 scores a Critical Wound. Instead of allocating 
the attack and making saving throws normally, the target suffers 2 mortal wounds.
 ■ A Critical Wound inflicts mortal wounds equal to the weapon’s Damage characteristic, instead of any normal damage.SUSTAINED HITS
Some weapons strike in a flurry of blows, tearing the foe apart with relentless ferocity. 
Weapons with 
[SUSTAINED HITS X]  in their profile are 
known as Sustained Hits weapons. Each time an 
attack is made with such a weapon, if a Critical Hit is rolled, that attack scores a number of additional hits on the target as denoted by ‘x’.  
Example:  A model makes an attack with a melee 
weapon with the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 2]  ability. If the 
Hit roll is an unmodified 6 (a Critical Hit), then that attack scores a total of 3 hits on the target (1 from the successful Hit roll of 6, and 2 from the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 2]  ability).
 ■ [SUSTAINED HITS X] : Each Critical Hit scores ‘x’ 
additional hits on the target.
EXTRA ATTACKS
Some warriors ride to battle atop trusty mounts that gore and trample nearby foes. Others wield combat weapons that deliver a frenzy of additional blows. 
Weapons with 
[EXTRA ATTACKS]  in their profile are 
known as Extra Attacks weapons. Each time the 
bearer of such a weapon fights, it can make attacks with that weapon in addition to the one it chooses to fight with. The number of attacks made with an Extra Attacks weapon cannot be modified by other rules. 
 ■ The bearer can attack with this weapon in addition to any other weapons it can make attacks with.
ANTI
Certain weapons are the bane of a particular foe.
Weapons with [ANTI-KEYWORD X+]  in their profile are 
known as Anti weapons. Each time an attack is 
made with such a weapon against a target with the keyword after the word ‘ Anti-’ , an unmodified Wound roll of ‘x+’ scores a Critical Wound. 
Example:  An attack made with an 
[ANTI-VEHICLE 4+]  
weapon will score a Critical Wound against – and so successfully wound – a Vehicle unit on an unmodified Wound roll of 4+, while an attack made with an 
[ANTI-PSYKER 2+]  weapon will score a Critical 
Wound against – and so successfully wound – a Psyker unit on an unmodified Wound roll of 2+.
 ■ [ANTI-KEYWORD X+] : An unmodified Wound roll of 
‘x+’ against a target with the matching keyword scores a Critical Wound.

5In your Charge phase, if you have any eligible units from your 
army on the battlefield that you want to charge into close combat, you can select those units, one at a time, to declare a charge. Each can only be selected once per phase. Once all of these charges (if any) have been resolved, progress to the Fight phase. 
A unit is eligible to charge if it is within 12" of one or more 
enemy units at the start of your Charge phase, unless any of the 
following apply:
 ■That unit Advanced or Fell Back this turn.
 ■ That unit is within Engagement Range of any enemy models.
 ■That unit is an Aircraft unit.
CHARGING WITH A UNIT
Once you have selected an eligible unit to declare a charge, you 
must select one or more enemy units within 12" of it as the targets of that charge. The targets of a charge do not need to be visible to the charging unit. 
Y ou then make a Charge roll for the charging unit by rolling 
2D6. The result is the maximum number of inches each model in that unit can be moved if a Charge move is possible. For a Charge move to be possible, the Charge roll must be sufficient to 
enable the charging unit to end that move:
 ■ Within Engagement Range of every unit that you selected as a 
target of the charge.
 ■ Without moving within Engagement Range of any enemy 
units that were not a target of the charge.
 ■In Unit Coherency.
If any of these conditions cannot be met, the charge fails and 
no models in the charging unit move this phase. Otherwise, the charge is successful and the models in the charging unit make a Charge move – move each model a distance in inches up to the result of the Charge roll. When doing so, each model in the charging unit must end its Charge move closer to one of the units selected as a target of its charge. If you can also move a 
charging model so that it ends its Charge move in base-to-base 
contact with one or more enemy models while still enabling the charging unit to end its move satisfying all of the conditions above, you must do so. The controlling player chooses the order in which to move their models.
 ■ Charge Roll: 2D6".
 ■ T argets of a charge must be within 1 2" but do not need to be visible.
 ■  If the distance rolled is insufficient to move within Engagement 
Range of all targets while maintaining Unit Coherency, the 
charge fails.
 ■ Cannot move within Engagement Range of any unit that was not a 
target of the charge.
 ■ If the charge is successful, each model makes a Charge move less 
than or equal to the Charge roll, and must move into base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible.CHARGE PHASE 
Warriors hurl themselves into battle to slay with blade, hammer and claw. Strident war cries and frantic 
screams echo through the whirling smoke as the moment of cataclysmic violence draws near. 
Use the following sequence to

CHARGING OVER TERRAIN
Unless otherwise stated, a model can be moved 
over a terrain feature when it makes a Charge move, but not through it.
A model can be moved over terrain features that 
are 2" or less in height as if they were not there. A model can be moved vertically in order to climb up, down and over any terrain features that are taller than this, counting the vertical distance up 
and/or down as part of its Charge move. Models 
cannot end a Charge move mid-climb – if it is not possible to make a Charge move as a result, the charge fails.
 ■ Models can be moved freely over terrain 
features 2" or less in height.
 ■ Models cannot move through terrain 
features taller than 2", but can climb up and down them.
CORE RULES | CHARGE PHASECHARGING WITH FLYING MODELS
When a model that can Fly  starts or ends a Charge 
move on a terrain feature, instead of measuring the path it has moved across the battlefield, you instead measure its path ‘through the air’ . In addition, it can be moved over other models as if they were not there. A model that can Fly  cannot 
end any move on top of another model.
 ■ Fly models can move over other models 
when they make a Charge move.
 ■ Fly models that start or end a Charge move 
on a terrain feature measure distance moved through the air when they make a Charge move.

The Von Ryan’s Leaper 
declares a charge against 
the Eradicators, who are 
on top of a terrain feature 
3" in height. The horizontal 
distance between the two 
units when the charge is 
declared is 4 1/2". To end 
a Charge move within Engagement Range, the 
Tyranids player would need 
a Charge roll of 7 or higher.
The Tyranid Prime is selected to declare 
a charge, and targets the Sternguard Veterans on top of the ruin. The Tyranids 
player rolls 10" for the Charge roll, 
allowing the Tyranid Prime to move within 
Engagement Range of its target.
Note that as the Tyranid Prime can Fly , it 
can move over the Terminators, and the 
distance moved is the diagonal distance through the air.

FIGHT PHASE 
Carnage engulfs the battlefield as the warring armies meet head-on. Fangs and claws crunch through 
bone. Blades ring like hammers on anvils. Blood spurts and flesh tears as hate-filled foes tear one another apart.
In both steps of the Fight phase, players alternate selecting 
eligible units from their army, one at a time, starting with the player whose turn is not taking place, and fighting with them. Note that a player cannot pass or opt not to fight when they have one or more eligible units that could fight – they must select one of them to fight.
In both steps, a unit is eligible to fight if either or both of the 
following apply:
 ■ It is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.
 ■It made a Charge move this turn. 
 No unit can fight more than once in the Fight phase. In each step, if all of one player’s eligible units that can fight during that step have fought, the opposing player can then fight with all of their remaining eligible units that can fight during that step, one at a time. 
Once neither player has any eligible units to fight with during 
the current step, you progress to the next step. Once all eligible 
units have fought in every step, the Fight phase ends. The player’s turn then ends and, unless the battle ends, the next player’s turn begins.
Note that after an enemy unit has fought and finished its 
Consolidation move (pg 35), it might be that previously ineligible units are now eligible – these units can then be selected to fight during the Remaining Combats step.
1. FIGHTS FIRST
In this step, all eligible units with the Fights First ability fight (pg 33-36). Remember that this will include units that made a Charge move this turn and that have a Charge bonus (pg 29).
2. REMAINING COMBATS
In this step, all remaining eligible units fight. This includes any units with the Fights First ability that were not eligible to fight at the start of the Fight phase, but have since become eligible to fight.The Fight phase is split into two steps. Units that have the ability to 
Fight First do so, followed by any 
remaining eligible units.

41. PILE IN
When a unit Piles In, you can move each model in that unit 
that is not already in base-to-base contact with an enemy model up to 3" – this is a Pile-in move. For a Pile In to be possible, a unit must be able to end these moves within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units and in Unit Coherency. If these conditions cannot be met, no models in the unit can make Pile-in moves this phase and you progress to making melee attacks with that unit. Otherwise, the unit can make Pile-in moves. 
Each time a model makes a Pile-in move, it must end that 
move closer to the closest enemy model. If it can also end that move in base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models while still satisfying all of the conditions above, it must do so. The controlling player chooses the order in which to move their models.
 ■ Pile-in Move: Up to 3".
 ■ Every model that moves must end closer to the closest 
enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit (or no models can Pile In).
2. MAKE MELEE ATTACKS
When a unit makes its melee attacks, before resolving those attacks you must first determine which models can fight, then select which melee weapon each of those models will make attacks with, then select the targets for those attacks.
WHICH MODELS FIGHT
When a unit makes its melee attacks, only models in that unit that are either within Engagement Range of an enemy unit, or in base-to-base contact with another model from their own unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with an enemy unit, can fight.
 ■ A model can fight if it is within Engagement Range of an 
enemy unit.
 ■ A model can fight if it is in base-to-base contact 
with another model from its own unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with an enemy unit.
SELECT WEAPON
When a model fights, it must do so using a melee weapon it is equipped with. The weapons a model is equipped with are described on its datasheet. If a model has more than one melee weapon, it can only use one of them to make attacks with each time it fights, so you must now declare which it will use before resolving any of its attacks.Use the following sequence when a unit fights.

unit Consolidates.
CORE RULES | FIGHT PHASE | FIGHT

2

4If the selected weapon has more than one profile to choose 
between, a model can only use one of them to make attacks with each time it fights, so you must also declare which profile it will use before resolving any of its attacks.
When a model fights, it will make a number of melee attacks 
determined by the Attacks (A) characteristic of the melee weapon it is using. 
 ■ Each model that can fight does so using one of its 
melee weapons.
 ■ Each model makes a number of attacks equal to the Attacks 
characteristic of its selected weapon.
SELECT TARGETS
Before you resolve any melee attacks, you must first select the enemy units that will be the targets for all of those attacks. In order to select an enemy unit as the target of a melee attack, the attacking model must be either within Engagement Range of that enemy unit, or in base-to-base contact with another model in its own unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with that enemy unit.
If the melee weapon a model is using to fight with can make 
more than one attack, those attacks can all be made against 
the same target, or they can be split between different targets. Similarly, if a unit has more than one model, each model can make its attacks at the same, or different, targets. In either case, declare which attacks will target which units before any attacks are resolved.
If there are no eligible targets (because there are no enemy units 
within Engagement Range, for example) then that unit cannot make melee attacks this phase, but it can still Consolidate (pg 35).
 ■ Select targets for all attacks before any are resolved.  
 ■ Attacking model must either be within Engagement Range 
of an enemy unit to target it, or in base-to-base contact with another model in its unit that is itself in base-to-base contact with that enemy unit.
MAKE ATTACKS
Melee attacks follow the same attack sequence as ranged attacks (see Making Attacks, pages 21-23), and you make one Hit roll for each attack being made.
If more than one enemy unit has been targeted by an attacking 
unit’s melee attacks, resolve all of the attacks against one target before moving onto the next. 
If your unit is making attacks with more than one melee weapon 
against a unit, and those weapons have different profiles, then 
after you have resolved an attack with one of those weapons, if any other weapons with the same profile are also being used to make attacks against that unit, you must resolve those attacks before resolving any other attacks against the target. 
Note that all of the attacks you have declared targets for are 
always resolved against the target units, even if, when you come to resolve an attack, no models in the target unit of that attack

4remain within Engagement Range of the attacking model’s unit 
(because of models being destroyed as the result of other attacks made by the attacking model’s unit, for example).
 ■ Resolve all attacks against one unit before moving onto 
the next. 
 ■ Resolve all attacks with the same weapon profile before 
resolving any made with a different weapon profile.
 ■ All attacks declared against a target unit are resolved, even 
if no models in that unit remain within Engagement Range.
3. CONSOLIDATE
After a unit has finished making all of its melee attacks, it Consolidates. Each time a unit Consolidates, you can move each model in that unit that is not already in base-to-base contact with an enemy model up to 3" – this is a Consolidation move. For a Consolidation to be possible, a unit must be able to end these moves within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units and in Unit Coherency. If these conditions cannot be met, then each model in that unit can instead make a Consolidation move towards the closest objective marker, but only if, after 
doing so, that unit is within range of that objective marker and 
in Unit Coherency. If these conditions also cannot be met, no models in the unit can make Consolidation moves this phase and that unit’s fight ends. 
If a unit can end its Consolidation within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units, then each time one of its models makes a Consolidation move, it must end that move closer to the closest enemy model. If it can also end that move in base-to-base contact with one or more enemy models while still satisfying all of the conditions above, it must do so. The controlling player chooses the order in which to move their models.
 ■Consolidation Move: Up to 3".
 ■ Every model that moves must end closer to the closest 
enemy model, and in base-to-base contact with an enemy model if possible. The unit must end in Unit Coherency and within Engagement Range of at least one enemy unit if possible.
 ■ If the above is not possible, each model can move towards 
the closest objective marker, but this must result in the unit being within range of it and in Unit Coherency.
 ■ If the above is also not possible, no models can Consolidate.

A The Termagant unit is selected to fight. First, the unit 
Piles In and all of its models move up to 3" in order to 
end closer to the closest enemy model, and in 
base-to-base contact if they can. Note that two 
Termagants are already in base-to-base contact with 
the foe – these models therefore do not move.
B After making their Pile-in moves, five of the 
Termagants are within Engagement Range of the 
Sternguard Veterans, and so will get to make attacks. 
Three other Termagants are in base-to-base contact 
with models in their unit that are themselves in 
base-to-base contact with the Sternguard Veterans 
– these Termagants will also get to make attacks. The 
remaining two Termagants are too distant from the foe, and will not get to make attacks.
C After the Termagants have made all of their attacks, one enemy model has been destroyed. The Termagants now Consolidate; just like when they Piled In, each model must move up to 3" in order to end closer to the closest enemy 
model, and in base-to-base contact if they can. Three Termagants are already in base-to-base contact, and so are 
not moved.

CORE RULES | DATASHEETS1 DATASHEET NAME
Here you will find the name of the unit.
2 PROFILES
These contain the following characteristics 
that tell you how mighty the models in the unit are:
Move (M): This is the speed at which a 
model moves across the battlefield. If a model has a Move of ‘-’ it is unable to move at all.
Toughness (T): This reflects the model’s 
resilience against physical harm.
Save (Sv): This indicates the protection a 
model’s armour gives them.
Wounds (W): Wounds represent how 
much damage a model can sustain before it succumbs to its injuries. If a model’s Wounds characteristic is reduced to 0, that model is destroyed.
Leadership (Ld): This reveals how 
courageous, determined or self-controlled a model is. The lower this number, the better a model’s Leadership is.
Objective Control (OC): This shows how 
effectively a model can exert control over an objective on the battlefield. 
3 ABILITIES
Many units have special abilities and rules that may apply during the game, from Core Rules shared by many units to bespoke Psychic abilities and invulnerable saves. These will be described here, along with any rules that apply when larger models such as vehicles have suffered sufficient damage.
Some abilities are bestowed by items 
of wargear that models in a unit can be 
equipped with, and are known as Wargear abilities. These only apply while a model in the unit is equipped with the relevant item of wargear.4 WEAPONS
Weapons are described with the following characteristics:
Range: How far the weapon can shoot. 
Weapons with a range of ‘Melee’ are melee weapons and can only be used in close combat. All other weapons are ranged weapons.
Attacks (A): This tells you how many attacks 
are made each time that weapon is used. 
Weapon Skill (WS): This reflects the bearer’s 
skill in wielding the relevant melee weapon.
Ballistic Skill (BS): This shows how accurate 
the bearer is when shooting with the relevant ranged weapon.
Strength (S): How likely the weapon is to 
wound a foe.
Armour Penetration (AP): This represents 
the weapon’s ability to cut through the target’s defences.
Damage (D): The amount of damage 
inflicted by a successful wound.
5 KEYWORDS
Datasheets have a list of keywords, separated into Faction keywords and other keywords. The former are used when deciding which models to include in your army, but otherwise both sets of keywords are functionally the same.
6UNIT COMPOSITION  
AND OTHER RULES
This section details the number and types 
of models in the unit, and the default weapons and wargear those models are equipped with. It may also describe other interactions, such as how units with the Leader ability can attach to other units, and passenger restrictions that may apply to Transport models.
7 WARGEAR OPTIONS
Some datasheets have a bullet-pointed list of wargear options. When you include such a unit in your army, you can use these options to change the weapons and other wargear of models in the unit. The order you use these options in does not matter, but each can only be used once.LEADERSHIP TESTS
If a rule requires you to take a Leadership test for a unit, roll 2D6: if the total is greater than or equal to the best Leadership characteristic in that unit, that test is passed. Otherwise, it is failed. 
RANDOM CHARACTERISTICS
Some characteristics are a random value instead of a number. For example, a model’s Move characteristic might be 2D6", or a weapon’s Attacks characteristic might be D6. When a unit with a random Move characteristic is selected to move, determine the entire unit’s move distance by 
rolling the indicated number of 
dice. For all other characteristics, roll to determine the value on 
an individual, per - model or 
per-weapon basis each time that characteristic is required. 
AURA ABILITIES
Some abilities affect multiple models or units in a given range. These are known as Aura abilities and are tagged with the word ‘ Aura’ . A model with an Aura ability is always within range of its own Aura ability. A unit can be affected by more than one Aura ability at a time, but if a unit is within range of the same 
Aura ability more than once, that 
Aura ability only applies to that unit once.
PSYCHIC WEAPONS  
AND ABILITIES
Some weapons and abilities can only 
be used by Psykers. Such weapons and abilities are tagged with the word ‘Psychic’ . If a Psychic weapon or ability causes any unit to suffer one or more wounds, each of those wounds is considered to have been inflicted by a Psychic Attack.
38
DEEP STRIKE
Some units make their way to battle via tunnelling, 
teleportation, high-altitude descent or other extraordinary means that allow them to appear suddenly in the thick of the fighting.
During the Declare Battle Formations step, if every 
model in a unit has this ability, you can set it up in Reserves instead of setting it up on the battlefield. If you do, in the Reinforcements step of one of your 
Movement phases you can set up this unit anywhere 
on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
 ■ Unit can be set up in Reserves instead of on the battlefield.
 ■ Unit can be set up in your Reinforcements 
step, more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models.
SCOUTS
Scouts form the vanguard of many armies. Unnoticed by the enemy, they range ahead of the main force.
Some units have ‘Scouts x"’ listed in their abilities. 
If every model in a unit has this ability, then at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins, it can make a Normal move of up to x" as if it were your Movement phase – as can any Dedicated Transport model such a unit starts the 
battle embarked within (provided only models with 
this ability are embarked within that Dedicated Transport model). A unit that moves using this ability must end that move more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. If both players have units that can do this, the player who is taking the first turn moves their units first.
Example:  A unit has the Scouts 6" ability. At the 
start of the first battle round, the controlling player can make a Normal move with that unit of up to 6".
 ■ Scouts x": Unit can make a Normal move of up to x" before the first turn begins.
 ■ If embarked in a Dedicated Transport, 
that Dedicated Transport can make this move instead.
 ■ Must end this move more than 9" horizontally 
away from all enemy models.INFILTRATORS
Many armies employ reconnaissance units who can sit concealed, waiting for the right moment to strike.
During deployment, if every model in a unit has 
this ability, then when you set it up, it can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from the enemy deployment zone and all enemy models.
LEADER
Mighty heroes fight at the forefront of battle.
Some Character units have ‘Leader’ listed on their 
datasheets. Such Character units are known as Leaders, and the units they can lead – known as their Bodyguard units – are listed on their datasheet.
During the Declare Battle Formations step, for each 
Leader in your army, if your army also includes one 
or more of that Leader’s Bodyguard units, you can 
select one of those Bodyguard units. That Leader will then attach to that Bodyguard unit for the duration of the battle and is said to be leading that unit. Each Bodyguard unit can only have one Leader attached to it.
While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is 
known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack sucessfully wounds an Attached 
unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character 
model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit. 
 ■ Before the battle, Character units with the Leader ability can be attached to one of their Bodyguard units to form an Attached unit.
 ■ Attached units can only contain one Leader.
 ■ Attacks cannot be allocated to Character 
models in Attached units.DEPLOYMENT ABILITIES
Some abilities are used during deployment, or when setting a unit up – either on the battlefield or 
into Reserves. These are known as Deployment abilities, and some widespread examples of these are presented below.

STRATAGEMS
Command points can be spent during the battle to use Stratagems. All players can use the Core 
Stratagems presented here. Additional Stratagems can be found in Codexes and other publications.
When you use a Stratagem, reduce your 
CP total by the amount listed on that Stratagem. If you do not have enough CP for a specific Stratagem, you cannot use it. Y ou can use the same Stratagem multiple times during a battle, but you cannot use the same Stratagem more than once in the same phase. 
 ■ To use a Stratagem you must pay 
the CP specified.
 ■ The same Stratagem cannot 
be used more than once in the same phase.

STRATEGIC RESERVES
Strategic Reserves are forces that one or both players have chosen not to deploy at the start of the 
battle. These rules explain how to place units into Strategic Reserves, as well as how and when they arrive on the battlefield.
These rules let you place units into Strategic Reserves 
– a special type of Reserves you can use to keep units off the battlefield until you require them. Note that while all Strategic Reserves units are also technically Reserves units, the reverse is not true, and so these rules do not apply to units that are using other rules that enable them to start the battle in Reserves (e.g. Deep Strike). Such units are instead set up as described by those other rules.
PLACING UNITS INTO  
STRATEGIC RESERVES
Before the battle, when you are instructed to Declare 
Battle Formations, you can select one or more units from your army to be placed into Strategic Reserves (excluding Fortifications).
The combined points value of all the units you wish 
to place into Strategic Reserves before the battle (including those embarked within Transport models that are themselves placed into Strategic Reserves) 
cannot exceed 25% of your total points limit for your 
chosen battle size, as shown in the table below.

 ■ Combined points value cannot exceed 25% of

 ■ Cannot put Fortifications into 
Strategic Reserves.ARRIVING FROM STRATEGIC RESERVES
Units that are placed into Strategic Reserves are called Strategic Reserves units, and can arrive later in the battle during the Reinforcements step of any of your Movement phases except during the first battle round.
 Any Strategic Reserves units that are not on the 
battlefield at the end of the battle count as destroyed.
 ■ Strategic Reserves units can arrive in the 
Reinforcements step of your Movement phase, from the second battle round onwards.
 ■ Those not on the battlefield at the end of the 
battle count as destroyed.
SETTING UP STRATEGIC  
RESERVES UNITS
Where on the battlefield a Strategic Reserves unit 
can be set up when it arrives depends on the battle round, as follows:
 ■ During the second battle round, Strategic Reserves 
units that arrive must be set up wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge, but no model in those units can be set up within the enemy deployment zone.
 ■ Starting from the third battle round, Strategic 
Reserves units that arrive must be set up wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge. 
In any case, Strategic Reserves units cannot be set up within 9" horizontally of any enemy models. All other rules that apply when setting up Reserves units also apply when setting up Strategic Reserves units.
 ■ During the second battle round, set up wholly 
within 6" of any battlefield edge (not in enemy deployment zone).
 ■ From the third battle round onwards, set up 
wholly within 6" of any battlefield edge.
 ■ Cannot be set up within 9" of any 
enemy models.

CORE RULES | TERRAIN FEATURESThis section provides rules for using a range of terrain features that can transform your gaming table 
into an interactive, thematic battlefield set in the 41st Millennium. These rules help to bring your battlefield to life and introduce a vital tactical dimension to your games. TERRAIN FEATURES
Battlefields are populated with terrain features that 
your models will need to move over or around, and which can partially or fully block line of sight between models. The rules on the following pages apply to the most common terrain features on the battlefields of the 41st Millennium. Unless otherwise stated, models can move up, over and down terrain features following the normal rules for movement.
Many terrain features follow the normal rules for 
determining visibility between models (pg 8), but some interact differently; in either case, this is stated on the following pages. Terrain features cannot be selected as the target of an attack. 
BENEFIT OF COVER
Shattered ruins and twisted wreckage afford much-needed shelter from enemy salvoes. Even heavily armoured warriors unfazed by small arms fire are thankful for such cover when foes bring their biggest guns to bear.
Models can sometimes gain a measure of protection 
from terrain features. The rules on pages 45-48 detail the conditions under which a terrain feature confers 
the Benefit of Cover on a model.
Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model 
that has the Benefit of Cover, add 1 to the saving throw made for that attack (excluding invulnerable saving throws). Models with a Save characteristic of 3+ or better cannot have the Benefit of Cover against attacks with an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0. Multiple instances of the Benefit of Cover are not cumulative – a model cannot benefit from this rule more than once at any one time.
 ■ Benefit of Cover:  Add 1 to armour saving 
throws against ranged attacks.
 ■ Does not apply to models with a Save of 3+ or 
better against attacks with an AP of 0.
 ■Multiple instances are not cumulative.

CORE RULES | TERRAIN FEATURESFOOTPRINT
When this terrain feature is set up 
on the battlefield, both players must agree upon its footprint – that is, the boundary of the terrain feature at ground level. This is so that players know when a model is wholly within this terrain feature. If this terrain feature is mounted on a base, then this will define its footprint.
MOVEMENT
 Models can be moved over this terrain 
feature, as described on page 15.VISIBILITY 
Models and units that are wholly within this terrain feature are never considered to be fully visible to an observing model. Similarly, if a model that is not wholly within this terrain feature must look through or over this terrain feature in order to draw line of sight to another model, then that other model is never considered to be fully visible to that observing model, and so it will have the Benefit of Cover from this terrain feature. Aircraft  
and Towering  models are exceptions 
to this – visibility to and from such models is determined normally, even if this terrain feature is wholly in between them and the observing model. Models that are wholly within this terrain feature can see out of it normally. BENEFIT OF COVER
Each time a ranged attack is allocated to a model, if that model is either wholly within this terrain feature, or it is not fully visible to every model in the attacking unit because of this terrain feature, that model has the Benefit of Cover against that attack.

All other models can only be set up or end a move on the ground floor of this terrain feature.VISIBILITY 
Models cannot see over or through this terrain feature (i.e. a unit outside this terrain feature cannot draw line of sight to a target on the other side of it, even if it would be possible to draw line of sight to that target through open windows, doors, etc.). Aircraft

EXAMPLE BATTLEFIELDS
In the far future, battles are fought across an infinite variety of strange and alien planets where no land is left 
untouched by the tempest of war. Crystal moons, derelict space hulks, carnivorous death worlds and war-ravaged cityscapes are just a few of the fantastical landscapes that can be recreated.
Battlefields are typically created by placing Battlezones 
next to each other. Battlezones are Citadel terrain sets that include two boards (each approximately 22" by 30" in size) and a range of terrain features designed to be set up evenly on those boards for the best Warhammer 40,000 gaming experience. Don’t worry if your battlefield doesn’t match these requirements, but keep in mind that playing on a battlefield that is either a barren wasteland or filled to overflowing with terrain features may give an advantage to 
one side or the other.
Below is an example of a battlefield set up for a Strike Force 
battle, with a good mixture of different terrain features fairly distributed across the battlefield. Their placement will create a dynamic gaming experience that doesn’t favour one player over the other. 
Importantly, some terrain features that block visibility have 
been placed near the middle of the battlefield, ensuring that it is not easy to see from one side of the battlefield to the other. Battlefields where this is not the case can advantage armies that rely on shooting, or disadvantage 
armies that rely on melee. There is also sufficient room 
for larger models such as vehicles to manoeuvre around the terrain features, especially near the edges, without getting trapped. 
Matched Play Focused: This is a Strike Force battlefield (44" x 60") set up with an aspirational number and mixture of terrain features. Their 
placement creates a battlefield that does not give an advantage to one player or the other, making it well suited to an aspirational matched play game. While this battlefield uses lots of Battlezone: Fronteris terrain features, you could achieve the same gaming experience using many different kinds of terrain, bearing in mind the concepts discussed above.
CORE RULES | EXAMPLE BATTLEFIELDS

Matched Play Focused: This Strike Force battlefield has fewer terrain features set 
up on it than the one below. The terrain has still been set up so as not to give an advantage to one player or the other, and there is still terrain set up in the middle that blocks visibility from one side of the battlefield to the other. As a result, this battlefield would make for an ideal matched play game. Battlefields with less terrain than this will start to advantage armies that rely on shooting over melee. 
50
Narrative Play Focused: This Strike Force battlefield has an ideal number and 
mixture of terrain features. The largest pieces of Area Terrain have been set up 
along the two long battlefield edges, while the middle of the battlefield only has a scattering of Obstacles to provide any kind of shelter from enemy fire. While this battlefield is not ideal for a matched play game, it would make for a very thematic set-up for a narrative play game.
Matched Play Focused: This Strike Force battlefield is very similar to the one above in terms of number and types of terrain features, but they have been set up more evenly across the battlefield, and the middle contains terrain features that block visibility from one side of the battlefield to the other. This battlefield doesn’t give an advantage to one player or the other, and is far more suited to a typical matched play game. 
CORE RULES | EXAMPLE BATTLEFIELDS
51
Matched Play Focused: This Combat Patrol battlefield (44" x 30") has an ideal 
number and mixture of terrain features. These are set up evenly across the 
battlefield, there is still space for units to manoeuvre around them, and lines of sight cannot easily be drawn from one edge to the other, giving neither player a clear advantage.
Matched Play Focused: This Combat Patrol battlefield has been set up with 
fewer terrain features than the battlefield above, but the positioning of these does not favour one player over the other. A battlefield with fewer terrain features than this will afford units no way to gain protection from ranged attacks, and so will give a strong advantage to armies that rely on shooting, while disadvantaging armies that rely on melee.
Narrative Play Focused: This Combat Patrol battlefield has an ideal number 
and mixture of terrain features, and has been set up to create a strong thematic battlefield that, while not ideally suited to all play styles, sets the scene for a thrilling narrative encounter.

AIRCRAFT
The airspace above a battle is often thronged with activity. Fighters and bomber craft hurtle through the skies, 
duelling with one another and strafing enemy formations on the ground.
Some models have the Aircraft keyword. The 
following rules describe how such models operate on the battlefield.
DEPLOYING AIRCRAFT
When you are instructed to Declare Battle Formations, Aircraft models must start the battle in Reserves instead of being set up on the battlefield. Once the battle has started, Aircraft models are then treated as Strategic Reserves units for all rules purposes (pg 43). Only units that are themselves placed into Reserves can start the battle embarked within Aircraft Transport models that are in Reserves.AIRCRAFT IN THE MOVEMENT PHASE
Aircraft models cannot Advance, Fall Back or Remain Stationary. If, when an Aircraft model is selected to move in the Movement phase, any enemy units are within Engagement Range of it, that Aircraft model can still make a Normal move. 
Each time an Aircraft model makes a Normal move, 
first move the model straight forward, and it must move a minimum of 20" – all parts of the model’s 
base must end the move at least this far from where 
they started. After it has moved, it can pivot on the spot up to 90° – this does not contribute to how far the model moves. If, when making a Normal move, any part of an Aircraft model’s base crosses the edge of the battlefield, or it cannot move a minimum of 20", that model’s move ends and it is placed into Strategic Reserves. There is no upper limit to how far Aircraft models can move, and their Move characteristic is therefore 20+".
If placed into Strategic Reserves, an Aircraft model 
will always arrive from Strategic Reserves in your next turn.
 ■ Aircraft can only make a Normal move, and can do so even when within Engagement Range of enemy models.
 ■ Aircraft  must move straight forward at least 
20", and can then make one pivot of up to 90°.
 ■ Aircraft that cross the edge of the battlefield, or that cannot make their minimum move, are placed into Strategic Reserves.
CORE RULES | AIRCRAFT
HOVER
Some aircraft can use vectored thrusters or anti-grav technology to hover over the battlefield, the better to hunt their prey or deploy embarked troops.
Some Aircraft models have ‘Hover’ listed 
in their abilities. When you are instructed to Declare Battle Formations, before doing anything else, you must first declare which 
models from your army with this ability will be 
in Hover mode.
If a model is in Hover mode, then until the end 
of the battle, its Move characteristic is changed to 20", it loses the Aircraft keyword and it loses all associated rules for being an Aircraft model. 
Models in Hover mode do not start the battle in Reserves, but you can choose to place them into Strategic Reserves following the normal rules if you wish.
53
AIRCRAFT AND THE MOVEMENT OF  
OTHER MODELS
When a unit is selected to move in the Movement 
phase, if the only enemy models that are within Engagement Range of that unit are Aircraft models, then that unit can still make a Normal or Advance move.
Whenever a model makes any kind of move, it 
can be moved over enemy Aircraft models as if they were not there, and can be moved within 
Engagement Range of enemy Aircraft models, 
but it cannot end that move on top of another model or within Engagement Range of any enemy Aircraft models.
 ■ Units can still make a Normal or Advance move 
if they are only within Engagement Range of enemy Aircraft.
 ■ Models can move within Engagement Range of 
enemy Aircraft, but cannot end a move within 
Engagement Range of enemy Aircraft.
 ■ Models can move over Aircraft when they 
make any kind of move.AIRCRAFT IN THE CHARGE  
AND FIGHT PHASES
Aircraft units cannot declare a charge, and only 
units that can Fly  can select an Aircraft unit as 
a target of their charge. Such units can end their Charge move within Engagement Range of one or more enemy Aircraft units.
An Aircraft model is only eligible to fight if it is 
within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units that can Fly, and it can only make melee attacks 
against units that can Fly . Only models that can Fly  
can make melee attacks against Aircraft units.
Aircraft models cannot make Pile-in or 
Consolidation moves. Each time a model makes a Pile-in or Consolidation move, unless that model can Fly, Aircraft models are ignored for the purposes of 
moving closer to the closest enemy model.
 ■ Only units that can Fly can charge at or make 
melee attacks against Aircraft.
 ■ Aircraft cannot charge, Pile In or Consolidate, and can only make melee attacks against units that can Fly .
 ■ When a model Piles In or Consolidates, unless it 
can Fly , ignore Aircraft when determining the 
closest enemy model.
CORE RULES | AIRCRAFT
A The Stormtalon Gunship begins the Movement phase within 
Engagement Range of the Tyranid Prime. The Stormtalon is 
an Aircraft model and is not in Hover mode, so is free to 
make a Normal move.
B The Stormtalon must move a minimum of 20" straight 
forward, even though this would bring it within Engagement 
Range of an enemy unit.
C After finishing its Normal move, the Stormtalon can then 
pivot on the spot up to 90º.
Note that if at any point during its move the Stormtalon would leave the battlefield due to the minimum movement requirement, 
it is placed into Strategic Reserves and will arrive in its controlling 
player’s next turn.

 1 2MUSTER YOUR ARMY
In order to play a game of Warhammer 40,000, you will need to muster an army. To do so, follow the sequence below.
With your opponent, select one 
of the battle sizes below. This will 
determine the total number of 
points each player can spend to 
build their army and, as a result, 
how long the battle will last. Points 
are a measure of a unit’s power on 
the battlefield; the higher a unit’s 
points value, the more powerful that 
unit is. The points values for units 
are presented in other publications, 
such as Codexes and the Munitorum 
Field Manual. You will need to refer 
to these when building your army.

Points per Army 1000
Duration Up to 2 hours
STRIKE FORCE
Points per Army 2000

recorded on an Army Roster. This 
can be written on a piece of paper 
or recorded using the Warhammer

their finished Army Roster to their 
opponent before battle commences. 
You can download blank Army

Some Detachment rules list units 
that you either must include or 
cannot include in your army; you 
must follow all such rules when 
building your army.Select all the units you want 
to include in your army. Your 
army must include at least one 
Character unit. Each time you 
include a unit in your army, it can 
take any upgrade, Enhancement 
or options it has access to. Note on 
your Army Roster the number of 
models in the unit, any weapons, 
wargear, upgrades and any 
Enhancement it has, and its points 
value. Subtract this points value 
from the total permitted for your 
battle size.
You can only include a unit in your 
army if:
 ■ That unit has the Faction  
keyword you chose for your  
army in step 3.
 ■ You have enough 
points remaining.
 ■ Your army does not already 
contain three units with the same datasheet name as that unit – or six units with the same datasheet name as that unit if it is a Battleline or Dedicated Transport* unit.
Only Characters can be given 
Enhancements and your army 
cannot include more than three 
Enhancements in total. No unit can 
have more than one Enhancement 
and each Enhancement included 
in your army must be unique. 
Epic Heroes cannot be given any 
Enhancements. Your army cannot 
include the same Epic Hero more 
than once.  
* Every Dedicated Transport unit from 
your army must start the battle with at least 
one unit embarked within it, or it cannot be 
deployed for that battle and will instead 
count as having been destroyed during the 
first battle round.Select one Character model from 
your army to be your Warlord – this

MUSTER ARMIES
Players muster their armies 
based on their selected battle 
size, as described on pages 
55-56. Each mission will guide 
players on what size of battle 
they can play, and may include 
further rules that could affect 
how players pick their armies.
2
READ MISSION 
OBJECTIVES
Each mission will state what 
its primary objectives are, and 
may also include one or more 
special rules. These cover unique 
situations, or abilities that can be 
used in the battle.
3
CREATE THE 
BATTLEFIELD
Each mission will include details 
of the size of the battlefield that 
you will need. Each mission will 
also instruct you if any terrain 
features or objective markers 
must be set up, and will provide 
details of where to set them up. 
Otherwise, it is assumed you are 
using the guidelines on pages 
49-52 to create your battlefield. 
If you are using a battlefield that 
is a different size or shape to 
those guidelines, you will need to 
adjust distances, and the location 
of deployment zones, objective 
markers and terrain features, in 
an appropriate way.4
DETERMINE ATTACKER 
AND DEFENDER
Players roll off and the winner is 
the Attacker – their opponent is 
the Defender.
5
DECLARE BATTLE 
FORMATIONS
In the order stated below, both 
players now secretly note down:
 ■ Which of their Leader units will 
start the battle attached (they must specify which Leader unit is attached to which Bodyguard unit).
 ■  Which of their units will 
start the battle embarked within Transport models (they must specify which units are embarked within which models).
 ■ Which of their units will 
start the battle in Reserves (including Strategic Reserves). 
When both players have done so, 
they declare their selections to 
their opponent.
6
DEPLOY ARMIES
Each mission includes a 
deployment map that shows 
where each player can set up 
the models in their army (called 
their deployment zone), and will 
list any restrictions that apply to 
setting up.7
DETERMINE 
FIRST TURN
Each mission will tell you how to 
determine which player has the 
first turn.

RESOLVE  
PRE-BATTLE RULES
Players alternate resolving any 
pre-battle rules units from their 
armies have, starting with the 
player who will take the first turn. 
9
BEGIN THE BATTLE
The first battle round begins. 
Players continue to complete 
battle rounds until the 
battle ends. 
10
END THE BATTLE
Each mission will tell you when 
the battle ends. This will typically 
be after a set number of battle 
rounds have been completed, or 
when one player has achieved a 
certain victory condition.
11
DETERMINE VICTOR
Each mission will tell you what 
you need to do in order to win the 
game. If neither player manages 
to achieve a victory then the 
game is considered to be a draw.MISSIONS
Before you can wage war in a game of Warhammer 40,000, you must first select a mission. The Core 
Rules include a single mission – Only War – that is ideal to get the action started quickly. Others can be found elsewhere in this or other books, or you could play a mission of your own creation. If you and your opponent can’t agree which mission to play, you must roll off, and the winner decides. 
CORE RULES | MISSIONS
57
OBJECTIVE MARKERS
Objective markers represent objects of tactical or strategic 
import that both sides are attempting to secure, such as valuable artefacts, vital supplies or communications nodes. If a mission uses objective markers, it will state where they are located on the battlefield. These can be represented using any suitable marker, but we recommend using round markers that are 40mm in diameter.
When setting objective markers up on the battlefield, place them 
so they are centred on the point specified by the mission. When 
measuring distances to and from objective markers, measure to and from the closest part of them. Models can move over objective markers as if they were not there, but they cannot end a move on top of an objective marker.
At the start of the battle, each objective marker on the battlefield 
is said to be contested, and so is not controlled by either player. To control an objective marker, a player will first need to move models within range of it. A model is within range of an objective marker if it is within 3" horizontally and 5" vertically of that objective marker.
Every model has an Objective Control (OC) characteristic listed 
on its datasheet. To determine a player’s Level of Control over an objective marker, add together the OC characteristics of all the models from that player’s army that are within range of that 
objective marker. A player will control an objective marker at the 
end of any phase if their Level of Control over it is greater than their opponent’s. If both players have the same Level of Control over an objective marker, that objective marker is contested. 
 ■ A model is within range of an objective marker if within 3" 
horizontally and 5" vertically.
 ■ Level of Control: Add together the OC characteristics of all of a player’s models within range of the objective marker.
 ■ An objective marker is controlled by the player with the 
highest Level of Control over it (in a tie, it is contested).
 ■Models cannot end a move on top of an objective marker.

 The locations of objective markers on 
the battlefield are typically shown on the deployment map of the mission being played, and are represented by this icon.
CORE RULES | MISSIONS | OBJECTIVE MARKERSHints and Tips
OBJECTIVE MARKERS AND 
TERRAIN FEATURES
Many players choose to bring the 
narrative of their missions to life by positioning objective markers within exciting terrain features on the battlefield. When setting up terrain features, you can place them where an objective marker would be, so long as you can reposition that objective marker directly on top of that terrain 
feature and it lies flat, without 
overhanging any part of it. That objective marker should still be more than 1" away from all impassable parts of that terrain feature (such as the walls of a ruin) so that there is sufficient room for models to move around it. 
If it is not possible to set up terrain 
features or objective markers in this way, and both players agree, you can nudge the positions of any terrain feature or objective marker so that these conditions are satisfied. Of course, the final position of an objective marker should 
still be as close as possible to the 
location indicated on your mission’s deployment map, but if both players are happy to tweak the battlefield arrangement to forge a stronger narrative, you should feel free to do so.

Progressive Objective
Starting from the second battle round, at the end of each player’s Command phase, the player whose turn it is scores 1 Victory point (VP) for each objective marker they control (to a maximum of 3VP per turn). Details of how to control objective markers can be found on page 58.3 CREATE THE BATTLEFIELD
Players now create the battlefield and set up terrain features using the guidelines on pages 49-52. The minimum size of your battlefield depends on the battle size you have selected, as shown in the table below.

6 DEPLOY ARMIES
Players then alternate deploying their units, one 
at a time, starting with the Attacker. Models must be set up wholly within their controlling player’s deployment zone. Continue setting up units until both players have set up all the units from their armies, or you have run out of room to set up more units. If one player has finished setting up their army, their opponent continues to set up the remaining units from their army. 
If both players have units with abilities that allow 
them to be set up after both armies have deployed, the players must roll off after all other units have been set up and alternate setting up those units, starting with the winner.
7 DETERMINE FIRST TURN
Players should roll off again, and the winner takes the first turn.
8 RESOLVE PRE-BATTLE RULES
Players now resolve any pre-battle rules their armies have. 9 BEGIN THE BATTLE
The first battle round begins. Players continue to resolve battle rounds until the battle ends. 
10 END THE BATTLE
The battle ends when all of the models in one player’s army have been destroyed, or once the fifth battle round has ended (whichever comes first). 
11 DETERMINE VICTOR
If, at the end of the battle, one army has been destroyed, the player commanding the opposing army is the victor. Otherwise, the player with the most Victory points is the victor (in the case of a tie, the battle is a draw).

enemies of Mankind across the Sea of Stars, the 
Space Wolves employ the advanced technology and 
deadly weapons of the Adeptus Astartes under a skin 
of seemingly feral barbarity. With audacious boasts, 
the taking of impetuous risks and the joyful roars 
of warriors born, the Space Wolves are a Chapter of 
heroes who wage war without fear or doubt, each 
seeking to forge a saga worthy of immortalisation.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Champions of Russ Detachment rule.

ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Champions of Russ Detachment rule, you can use these Champions of Russ Enhancements.
THE PELT OF BALEWOLF
The pelts of wolves are plentiful trophies amongst 
the heroes of Fenris. However, some of these mantles 
are rare and steeped in legend, belonging to one 
of the near-mythical Blackmaned wolves. The Pelt 
of Balewolf came from a giant of its massive kind. 
Even now, when the name of its heroic slayer is 
barely recalled, Balewolf ’s raw spirit still permeates 
the long-dead creature’s pelt, a bestial aura that 
reaches into primitive fear centres. Even the mighty 
instinctively tremble before the wearer, sensing the 
presence of a terrifying alpha predator.

WOLF TAIL TALISMAN
Although seen by the sons of Russ as tokens of 
luck and protection against evil, wolf tail talismans 
are regarded by most outside the Chapters of Russ’ 
genetic legacy as trinkets of mere superstition. Yet 
whether through the power of the bearer’s belief, 
some attribute inherent in the creatures they are 
taken from or some stranger reason, these talismans 
appear to bestow the warrior with a measure of 
protection against malicious attacks.

Adeptus Astartes model only. At the start of the Fight 
phase, each enemy unit within Engagement Range of 
the bearer must take a Battle-shock test.
BLACK DEATH
The sagas of Torvald Fangbreaker, of Gerd the Bloody 
and many others detail the sickening monsters and 
fell champions slain by Black Death. They tell of how 
the runic enchantments etched into the ebon weapon 
glow darkly in battle, transforming the bearer into a 
relentless killing machine.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s 
melee weapons have the [ANTI-MONSTER 4+] and 
[ANTI-VEHICLE 4+] abilities.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Each time an attack 
is allocated to the bearer, subtract 1 from the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.
FROST WEAPON
Amongst the most prized weapons of the sons of 
Russ – himself the Lord of Winter and War – these 
blisteringly cold weapons are specially crafted by 
a master Iron Priest. Some are wrought from the 
razor-sharp fangs of the Ice Kraken, while others 
are shards of energised diamond, giving them the 
appearance of blades forged from purest ice.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s melee 
weapons have the [PRECISION] ability, and the 
Strength and Armour Penetration characteristics of 
those weapons are improved by 1.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
DETACHMENT RULE

No matter the foe or the odds, the proud warriors of 
the Dark Angels stubbornly refuse to accept defeat. 
None fight with more grim determination than 
the battle-brothers of the Dark Angels, and their 
renowned specialised companies – the Deathwing 
and Ravenwing – are held in awe by their allies and 
enemies alike.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army can include Dark Angels units, but it 

cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn 
from any other Chapter.

GRIM RESOLVE
The Dark Angels are renowned for their unshakeable 
resolve, enduring tenacity and strict discipline in 
battle. They are tactically astute, able to prosecute 
their wars on any front. On the offence, they strike 
with all the martial pride of the Lion, while in defence 
they are stalwart, determined to accomplish their 
mission no matter the cost.

While an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
is Battle-shocked, change the Objective Control 
characteristic of models in that unit to 1, instead of 0.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task 
Force Stratagems.

1CP

UNFORGIVEN FURY

UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE  
TACTIC STRATAGEM

With focused aggression, the Dark Angels 
relentlessly punish the foe.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
weapons equipped by models in your 
unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability. In 
addition, if one or more Adeptus Astartes 
units from your army are currently 
Battle-shocked, until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, a successful unmodified Hit roll of 
5+ scores a Critical Hit.

INTRACTABLE
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC  
PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Although stubborn warriors, even the 
resolute Dark Angels know that a fighting 
retreat can be the wisest course of action.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, that unit 
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge, 
even though it Fell Back this phase.

1CP

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE  
TACTIC STRATAGEM

The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes 
combined with their transhuman 
physiology makes them unyielding foes 
to face.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

FIRE DISCIPLINE
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC 
STRATAGEM

1CP

There is no escaping the Unforgiven’s 
wrath when they bring their disciplined 
firepower to bear.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in that 
unit have the [ASSAULT], [HEAVY] and 
[IGNORES COVER] abilities.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE

If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task 
Force Stratagems.

1CP

GRIM RETRIBUTION
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – STRATEGIC  
PLOY STRATAGEM

The Dark Angels are renowned for yielding 
nothing to the enemy, and fighting back 
with unanswerable fury in the face of 
odds that would force even other Adeptus 
Astartes to reconsider their position.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has shot.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that had one or more models 
destroyed as a result of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
the enemy unit that just attacked it, and 
can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target.

UNBREAKABLE LINES
UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE – BATTLE TACTIC 
STRATAGEM

1CP

Countless assaults have faltered against 
the unbreakable ceramite wall that is the 
Unforgiven standing their ground.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, just 
after an enemy unit ends a Charge move.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army within Engagement Range of 
that enemy unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, each 
time an attack is allocated to a model in 
your unit, subtract 1 from the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.

DARK ANGELS – UNFORGIVEN TASK FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Unforgiven Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Unforgiven Task 
Force Enhancements.
SHROUD OF HEROES
When one of the Dark Angels’ mightiest warriors is 
slain in battle, his recovered remains are wrapped 
in a death shroud until he can be interred within the 
crypts of the Lion’s Sanctum. Pieces of this fabric are 
then stitched into a single set of robes known as the 
Shroud of Heroes, and those who wear it claim they 
can feel the powers of their predecessors refusing to 
let them yield while their duty remains unfulfilled.

HEAVENFALL BLADE
This weapon was bestowed upon the most 
honourable Knight of the Order before a long quest 
into the wilds of Caliban. Its blade is empowered 
by a force generator of magnificent strength. It is a 
weighty responsibility to bear such an heirloom into 
battle, and a Dark Angel bestowed such an honour 
would rather die than bring shame to his Chapter.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The first time the 
bearer is destroyed, roll one D6 at the end of the 
phase. On a 2+, set the bearer back up on the 
battlefield as close as possible to where it was 
destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any 
enemy units, with 3 wounds remaining (if the bearer 
was Battle-shocked when it was destroyed, it is 
instead returned with its full wounds remaining).
STUBBORN TENACITY
Even for a Chapter as famously stubborn as the Dark 
Angels, this warrior is known for his intractable nature. 
Such tenacity and dedication to duty is an inspiration 
to the warriors who follow him – so fortified, enemy 
attempts to break them only strengthen their resolve.

Adeptus Astartes model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, each time a model in that unit makes 
an attack, add 1 to the Hit roll if the bearer’s unit is 
below its Starting Strength, and add 1 to the Wound 
roll as well if the bearer’s unit is Battle-shocked.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Add 1 to the 
Attacks, Strength and Damage characteristics of 
the bearer’s melee weapons. While the bearer is 
Battle-shocked, add 2 to the Attacks, Strength 
and Damage characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons instead.
PENNANT OF REMEMBRANCE
This hallowed banner records the names and deeds 
of the legendary members of the Deathwing that the 
company’s bone-coloured armour commemorates. 
The legacy of those mighty warriors is one of bravery 
and defiance in the face of overwhelming odds. 
Under the shadow of their example, every member 
of the Chapter fights on through grievous injury 
to prove themselves worthy successors of such 
martial paragons.

Bladeguard Ancient, Primaris Ancient or 
Terminator Ancient model only. While the 
bearer is leading a unit, models in that unit 
have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. While that unit 
is Battle-shocked, models in that unit have the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability instead.

Battle-shocked, that Stratagem’s effects are not resolved (that Stratagem still counts as having been 
used this phase).

  T’AU EMPIRE
ARMY RULE

The Hunter Cadres battle for the betterment of 
the T’au Empire, not for personal gain or egotistic 
accomplishments. This burning commitment allows 
for prodigiously effective covering fire. Enemies are 
pinned in place by deadly bursts of pulse blasts, 
or the infamous T’au markerlight is used to expose 
even well-fortified enemy positions, allowing other 
T’au warriors to fall on the vulnerable enemies with 
murderous force.

FOR THE GREATER GOOD
If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, then in your 
Shooting phase units from your army can work in 
pairs to help each other target specific enemy units. 
When they do this, one unit is the Observer unit and 
the other is their Guided unit. The enemy they are 
targeting is called their Spotted unit.

Each time you select this unit to shoot, if it is not an 
Observer unit, it can use this ability. If it does, select 
one other friendly unit with this ability that is also 
eligible to shoot (excluding Fortification, Battle-
shocked and Observer units). Until the end of 
the phase, this unit is considered a Guided 
unit, and that friendly unit is considered an 
Observer unit. Then select one enemy unit 
that is visible to both your units to be their 
Spotted unit.

Until the end of the phase:

 ■  Each time a model in a Guided unit makes 

an attack that targets their Spotted unit, 
improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of 
the attack by 1 and, if their Observer unit 
has the Markerlight keyword, the attack 
has the [IGNORES COVER] ability.

 ■  Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an 
attack that does not target their Spotted unit, 
worsen the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack 
by 1.

T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is T’au Empire, you can use this 
Kauyon Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  If your army includes any Ethereal units, it cannot 

include a Commander Farsight model.

 ■  If your army includes a Commander Farsight 

model, it cannot include any Ethereal units.

KAUYON
The tactical philosophy known as the Kauyon allows 
for T’au commanders to draw the enemy into a deadly 
trap, springing it at the prefect moment to deliver a 
storm of fatal strikes against which none can escape.

From the third battle round onwards, all ranged 
weapons equipped by T’au Empire models from your 
army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. While a unit is 
a Guided unit (see For the Greater Good), weapons in 
that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead.

STRIKE AND FADE

KAUYON – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

T’au are experts at harrying and

TARGET: One T’au Empire Battlesuit 
unit from your army that can Fly whose 
attacks have been resolved this phase.

a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Grenades unit 
from your army that was selected as one 
of the targets of that charge.
EFFECT: That enemy unit must 
immediately take a Battle-shock test, and 
until the end of the phase, subtract 2 from 
Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.

COMBAT EMBARKATION
KAUYON – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Those who act as the lure in the 
Kauyon must be ready to make a hasty 
withdrawal once the enemy closes into 
killing range, lest they be trapped.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Charge phase, 
just after an enemy unit has declared 
a charge.
TARGET: One T’au Empire Infantry unit 
from your army that was selected as one 
of the targets of that charge, and one 
friendly Transport.
EFFECT: Your unit can embark within that 
Transport. If it does, your opponent can 
select new targets for that charge.
RESTRICTIONS: Every model in your T’au 
Empire Infantry unit must be within 
3" of that Transport and there must be 
sufficient transport capacity to embark 
the entire unit.

T’AU EMPIRE – KAUYON
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Kauyon Detachment rule, you can use these Kauyon Enhancements. 
EXEMPLAR OF THE KAUYON
Long meditation upon the tenets of the Patient Hunter 
has seen this warrior master the application of this 
cunning ambush strategy. When they take to the 
battlefield, they embody the teachings of the Kauyon, 
much to the dismay of their luckless prey.

T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper 
models). While the bearer is leading a unit, that unit’s  
Kauyon Detachment rule takes effect from the second 
battle round onwards instead of the third. 
PRECISION OF THE PATIENT HUNTER
This warrior prowls the battlefield like a high-tech 
predator, stalking and assessing their quarry before 
they strike. When they do launch their assault, 
their every shot and blow is informed by careful 
observations, perfectly aimed where they will do the 
greatest harm.

T’au Empire model only. Each time the bearer makes 
a ranged attack, add 1 to the Hit roll. From the third 
battle round onwards, add 1 to the Wound roll as well.

PURETIDE ENGRAM NEUROCHIP
Commander Puretide was undoubtedly the most 
gifted T’au war leader of all time. The T’au were 
unwilling to lose his tactical and strategic brilliance, 
and upon his death, his mind was scanned and his 
accumulated memories committed to a holostorage 
personality unit on his birth world of Dal’yth. A sliver 
of that genius has been crafted into a neurochip. 
When surgically implanted into the brain of a Fire 
Caste Commander, the bearer can access much of 
the wisdom of Puretide himself, drawing upon a great 
reservoir of tactical acumen.

T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper 
models). Once per turn, you can use a Stratagem on 
the bearer’s unit, even if you have already used that 
Stratagem on a different unit this phase.
THROUGH UNITY, DEVASTATION
Having studied every nuance of the art of applied 
mass-firepower, this warrior has mastered its 
deployment. Under their calm tutelage and stern 
gaze, warriors of the Fire Caste maximise every shot 
they fire, creating a blizzard of deadly-accurate 
energy that can pick apart even the most heavily 
armoured targets.

T’au Empire model only (excluding Kroot Shaper 
models). While this model is leading a unit, each 
time that unit is an Observer unit, until the end of 
the phase, ranged weapons equipped by models in 
their Guided unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability while 
targeting their Spotted unit.

T’AU EMPIRE
DRONES

If you have upgraded a model to have a drone, place a Drone token next to your model as a reminder. These do 
not count as models for any rules purposes.

WORLD EATERS
ARMY RULE

Khorne is the god of warfare and slaughter, and provides mighty boons to those who consecrate the battlefield 
in his name.

BLESSINGS OF KHORNE
If your Army Faction is World Eaters, at the start of 
the battle round, you can make a Blessings of Khorne 
roll. To do so, roll eight D6. You can then use those dice 
to activate up to two Blessings of Khorne from the 
Blessings of Khorne list (see right). Each Blessing of 
Khorne specifies the dice results it requires (where 
a number is specified, a double or triple of that 
value or higher is required). You can only activate 
each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any 
unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are 
then discarded.

Once activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all 
units from your army with this ability until the end of 
the battle round.

Example: Ash makes their Blessings of Khorne roll 
and gets the following dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6.

First they use the two 6s to activate Warp Blades 
(which requires a double 5+), leaving the following 
dice: 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4.

They then use the two 2s to activate Wrathful 
Devotion (which requires any double), leaving the 
following dice: 1, 2, 3, 4.

However, now that they have activated two Blessings 
of Khorne, they cannot activate any more and the 
remaining dice are discarded.

RAGE-FUELLED INVIGORATION 
ANY DOUBLE
Add 2" to the Move characteristic of models in 
this unit.

WRATHFUL DEVOTION 
ANY DOUBLE
Models in this unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. 
If models in this unit already have the Feel No Pain 
ability, add 1 to their Feel No Pain rolls.

MARTIAL EXCELLENCE 
DOUBLE 3+
Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have 
the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

TOTAL CARNAGE
DOUBLE 4+ OR ANY TRIPLE
Each time a model in this unit is destroyed by a 
melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, 
roll one D6: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. The 
destroyed model can fight after the attacking model’s 
unit has finished making its attacks, and is then 
removed from play.

WARP BLADES
DOUBLE 5+ OR ANY TRIPLE
Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have 
the [LETHAL HITS] ability.

UNBRIDLED BLOODLUST 
DOUBLE 6 OR TRIPLE 4+
This unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in 
which it Advanced.

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is World Eaters, you can use 
this Berzerker Warband Detachment rule.

RELENTLESS RAGE
The World Eaters fight in a perpetual fury, 
driven ever onwards to slaughter all who 
stand in their way. All of their warriors have 
been subject to horrific psycho-surgery, 
implanted with crude devices that amplify 
their aggression, while some also submit to 
possession by the raging daemons of the 
Blood God. Whatever drives their berserk 
rage, these warriors only stop killing when 
every foe lies in ruin at their feet – and 
sometimes not even then.

Each time a World Eaters unit from 
your army is selected to fight, if 
that unit made a Charge move 
this turn, until the end of the 
phase, add 1 to the Strength and 
Attacks characteristics of melee 
weapons equipped by models 
in that unit.

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Berzerker Warband Detachment rule, you can use these Berzerker 
Warband Stratagems.

GORY MASSACRE

BERZERKER WARBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

1CP

Those who witness the massacres 
inflicted by the World Eaters flee to avoid 
being the next victims.

1CP

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that made a Charge move this 
turn and destroyed one or more enemy 
units this phase.
EFFECT: In your opponent’s next 
Command phase, each enemy unit within 
6" of your unit must take a Battle-shock 
test. If the unit taking that test is Below 
Half-strength, subtract 1 from that test. 
Enemy units affected by this Stratagem 
do not need to take any other Battle-shock 
tests in the same phase.

FOR THE SKULL THRONE!

BERZERKER WARBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

2CP

1CP

Khorne rewards those who test their might 
against the strongest foes, blessing the 
greatest warriors with his favour.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
melee attack that targets a Character, 
Monster or Vehicle unit, add 1 to the 
Wound roll. 

FOR THE BLOOD GOD!
BERZERKER WARBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

When blood spills, the blessings of the 
Blood God are bountiful.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after a World 
Eaters unit from your army destroys an 
enemy unit.
TARGET: That World Eaters unit.
EFFECT: Make a Blessings of Khorne 
roll. You can use the results of this roll 
to activate one Blessing of Khorne. 
That Blessing of Khorne does not count 
towards your maximum number of 
activated Blessings of Khorne, but all 
other rules for Blessings of Khorne apply.

KHORNE CARES NOT…

BERZERKER WARBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Khorne cares not from whence the blood 
flows, so long as it flows, and mere flesh 
wounds will not stay the wrath of the 
World Eaters.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of that enemy 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Damage characteristic of 
that attack. 

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Berzerker Warband Detachment rule, you can use these Berzerker 
Warband Stratagems.

BLOOD OFFERING

APOPLECTIC FRENZY

BERZERKER WARBAND – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

BERZERKER WARBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The blood of Khorne’s devoted warriors 
is still blood, and when the battleground 
runs red, it is still a worthy addition to the 
Blood God’s domain.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that was just destroyed 
while it was within range of an objective 
marker you controlled. You can use this 
Stratagem on that unit even though it was 
just destroyed.
EFFECT: That objective marker remains 
under your control, even if you have 
no models within range of it, until your 
opponent controls it at the start or end of 
any turn. 

1CP

Those who fight for Khorne are driven 
to even greater depths of rage, surging 
towards the foe in a barely controlled tide. 

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One World Eaters unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
move this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, if your 
unit Advances, do not make an Advance 
roll for it. Instead, until the end of the 
phase, add 6" to the Move characteristic 
of models in your unit.

WORLD EATERS – BERZERKER WARBAND
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Berzerker Warband Detachment rule, you can use these Berzerker Warband Enhancements.
FAVOURED OF KHORNE
This warrior has the favour of Khorne; the Blood God 
seems to aid him in his slaughter with a portion of his 
own power.

BATTLE-LUST
This veteran killer’s lust for battle draws him into any 
and all fights, his thirst driving him to new heights of 
battlefield frenzy.

World Eaters model only. You can select the 
bearer’s unit for the Heroic Intervention Stratagem for 
0CP, and can do so even if you have already targeted a 
different unit with that Stratagem this phase.
HELM OF BRAZEN IRE
This helm is forged from unbreakable brass from the 
Blood God’s own throne. Any who seek to take the 
bearer’s skull find that their blades break upon it.

World Eaters model only. Each time an attack 
is allocated to the bearer, halve the Damage 
characteristic of that attack.

World Eaters model only. Each time you make a 
Blessings of Khorne roll, before doing anything else, 
the bearer can use this Enhancement. If it does, 
discard all of the dice from that roll and make a new 
Blessings of Khorne roll. This new roll does not count 
as a re-roll, so any rules that enable you to re-roll or 
manipulate individual dice (e.g. Icon of Khorne) can 
still be used.
BERZERKER GLAIVE
The bearer of this daemon-infested weapon is driven 
to a state of apoplectic frenzy by the proximity of its 
red-hot steel.

World Eaters model only. Add 1 to the Attacks 
and Damage characteristics of melee weapons 
equipped by the bearer. Each time the bearer ends 
a Charge move, roll one D3; until the end of the turn, 
add the result of that roll to the Attacks and Damage 
characteristics of those melee weapons instead.

ABILITIES

FACTION: Blessings of Khorne

Blood Surge: Each time an enemy unit is selected to shoot, 
after that unit has finished making its attacks, if any models 
from this unit were destroyed as a result of those attacks, 
this unit can make a Blood Surge move. To do so, roll one D6: 
this unit can be moved a number of inches up to the result, 
but this unit must finish that move as close as possible to the 
closest enemy unit (excluding Aircraft). When doing so, 
those models can be moved within Engagement Range of that 
enemy unit. A unit cannot make a Blood Surge move while it 
is Battle-shocked.

WARGEAR ABILITIES

Icon of Khorne: Each time you make a Blessings of Khorne 
roll, if the bearer’s unit is within range of an objective marker 
you control, you can re-roll one of the dice.

 Before selecting targets for this weapon, select one of its profiles to make attacks with.

Berzerkers of Khorne relish their role as the Blood God’s sacred

action. Those who face them in battle disappear under a rain of heavy 
blows, each potent enough to shear limbs and shatter shields.

ARMY RULES

Beseeching the Chaos Gods with fanatical fervour, 
the profane champions of the Heretic Astartes pray 
for diabolic boons, promising the vilest of offerings in 
return for their power.

DARK PACTS
If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, each time a 
unit with this ability is selected to shoot or fight, it can 
make a Dark Pact. If it does, select one of the following 
abilities for that unit’s weapons to gain until the end 
of the phase:

 ■ [LETHAL HITS]
 ■ [SUSTAINED HITS 1]

Each time a unit makes a Dark Pact, after it has 
resolved its attacks, it must take a Leadership test; if 
that test is failed, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

THE LOST AND THE DAMNED
Some traitors have given themselves entirely 
to the service of the Dark Gods, and they 
are so lost to damnation that they barely 
resemble the warriors they once were.

If your Army Faction is Heretic Astartes, 
you can include any of the following 
units in your army, and when you do so 
their Faction keywords are replaced with 
Heretic Astartes:

 ■ Khorne Berzerkers (see World Eaters)
 ■ Rubric Marines (see Thousand Sons)
 ■ Plague Marines (see Death Guard)

The combined points value of such units you 
can include in your army depends on the 
battle size, as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

When mustering your army, each time you select a Heretic Astartes unit 
to include in your army, if that unit is not an Epic Hero and does not already 
have one or more of the keywords listed below, you must select one of the 
keywords listed below for that unit to gain (note which units gain which 
keywords in this way on your Army Roster). Each time a unit with one of 
these keywords makes a Dark Pact, it gains the associated ability below until 
the end of the phase.

STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Slaves to Darkness Detachment rule, you can use these Slaves to Darkness Stratagems.

1CP

ETERNAL HATE
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Heretic Astartes are fuelled by hate, a searing 
spite that burns fiercely within them unto the 
very moment of death. Even as their life force 
pours from terrible wounds, this loathing can 
drive them to fight on in a second wind of 
wrath. Those Heretic Astartes in thrall to the 
Blood God feel this enmity to an even greater 
extent than others, exploding with violence 
just as the enemy think they have finally 
ended them.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that 
model has not fought this phase, roll one 
D6, adding 1 to the result if it is a Khorne 
unit: on a 4+, do not remove it from play. That 
destroyed model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making its attacks, 
and is then removed from play.

INFERNAL RITES
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

With gruesome offerings and ritualised 
promises, the Chaos Space Marines seek 
the protection of their infernal masters.

WHEN:  Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

PROFANE ZEAL
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Fervent mortal followers flock to the 
champions of Chaos, damning their souls 
seeking promises of dark power.

WHEN:  Your Shooting phase or the 
Fight phase.
TARGET: : One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
shoot or fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit makes an 
attack, re-roll a Hit roll of 1 and re-roll a 
Wound roll of 1. If your unit is a Chaos 
Undivided unit, you can instead re-roll 
the Hit roll and you can re-roll the Wound 
roll for that attack.

STRATAGEM

Choking fogs echoing with the screams 
of tortured souls; dense clouds of bloated 
flies; deluges of bloody rain; whirlwinds of 
coruscating flames blazing in a thousand 
hues. Such warp-born phenomena can 
appear on the battlefield in an instant, 
and disappear just as quickly. All serve 
to obscure the Heretic Astartes from their 
terrified foes.

WHEN:  Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
unit has the Stealth ability. In addition, if 
your unit is a Nurgle unit, until the end of 
the phase, your unit can only be selected 
as the target of a ranged attack if the 
attacking model is within 12".

SKINSHIFT
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

With the Dark Gods and the powers of the 
warp on their side, Chaos Space Marines 
can cheat death altogether. Their foes 
look on in horror as killing wounds knit 
themselves together in a cacophony 
of hideous cracks and squelches and 
shattered armour reforms. After such a 
blessing, the Heretic Astartes are both 
something far greater, and far less, than 
what they once were.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: One model in your unit regains 
up to 3 lost wounds. In addition, if your 
unit is a Tzeentch unit below its Starting 
Strength, one destroyed model (excluding 
Character models) is returned to your 
unit with its full wounds remaining.

UNNATURAL SWIFTNESS
SLAVES TO DARKNESS – STRATEGIC  
PLOY STRATAGEM

Some Heretic Astartes appear to move 
with a speed that should be impossible, 
weapons and bodies seemingly moving 
from one place to another in the blink of 
an eye.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Heretic Astartes unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in 
a turn in which it Fell Back. In addition, if 
your unit is a Slaanesh unit, until the end 
of the turn, your unit is eligible to shoot 
and declare a charge in a turn in which 
it Advanced.

ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Slaves to Darkness Detachment rule, you can use these Slaves to Darkness Enhancements.
TALISMAN OF BURNING BLOOD
This talisman constantly drips with thick, bubbling 
gore. The air around it is so heavy with the charnel 
stench of the slaughterhouse that it imbues the 
bearer’s limbs with supernatural ferocity and strength 
– a welcome boon to those eager to claim the 
worthiest skulls for Khorne.

INTOXICATING ELIXIR
This dispenser is filled with a self-replenishing liquid 
that is pumped into the bearer’s bloodstream by 
the pint. Some say the liquid, which grants those 
that partake of it unholy physical power, is a nectar 
distilled from Slaanesh’s own pleasure gardens, for 
while it heightens the bearer’s abilities, foes caught 
in its soporific fumes are paralysed with terror 
and ecstasy.

Heretic Astartes Slaanesh model only. The bearer 
has the Feel No Pain 5+ ability. Each time the bearer 
shoots or fights, if the bearer’s unit made a Dark 
Pact this phase, after the bearer has resolved those 
attacks, select one enemy unit that was hit by one or 
more of those attacks; that enemy unit must take a 
Battle-shock test. 
LIBER HERETICUS
This cursed tome contains forbidden lore said to 
have been absorbed while the artefact consumed the 
minds of those who risked reading it. One with the 
strength to tame it can use it to empower their rituals.

Heretic Astartes Chaos Undivided model only. 
Each time the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, that 
unit’s weapons gain the [LETHAL HITS] and [SUSTAINED 
HITS 1] ability until the end of the phase, instead of 
just gaining one of those abilities.

Heretic Astartes Khorne model only. Add 1 to the 
Attacks and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons. Each time the bearer’s unit makes 
a Dark Pact, until the end of the phase, add D3 to the 
Attacks and Strength characteristics of the bearer’s 
melee weapons instead. 
EYE OF TZEENTCH
The Eye of Tzeentch is a relic that has been exposed 
to wild psychic energies for ten millennia. Champions  
who stare into the artefact’s unblinking depths can 
glean the secrets of the warp.

Heretic Astartes Tzeentch model only. Each time 
the bearer’s unit makes a Dark Pact, take a Leadership 
test for the bearer: if that test is passed, you gain 1CP. 
ORBS OF UNLIFE
Within these glassy spheres lurks a diluted life-eater 
virus. Although quick to burn out when the sphere is 
broken, everything nearby not touched by Nurgle’s 
bountiful blessings – flesh, armour and bone – finds 
itself consumed by the ravaging viral strain..

Heretic Astartes Nurgle model only. At the end 
of the Fight phase, roll one D6 for every enemy unit 
within 6" of the bearer, adding 1 to the result if the 
bearer’s unit made a Dark Pact that phase: on a 4+, 
that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

 ◦ 1 Cultist grenade launcher
 ◦ 1 flamer 
 ◦ 1 meltagun

 ◦ 1 Cultist sniper rifle

 ■ The Traitor Sergeant’s close combat weapon can be replaced with one of the following: 

 ◦ 1 chainsword
 ◦ 1 power weapon

 ■ The Traitor Sergeant’s corrupted pistol can be replaced with 1 boltgun.

UNIT COMPOSITION

 ■ 1 Traitor Sergeant

braying war cries, swift slaughter and violent sacrifices.

Whether petty tyrants who killed their way to dominance, or former 
officers brought low through corruption, Enforcers are now sadistic 
disciplinarians amongst the Militarum Traitoris. Some cement their 
position by exploiting savage Traitor Ogryns as living shields, crude 
line-breakers and added muscle to help impose their violent rule.

WEAPON LISTS

 ■  Several Heretic Astartes models have the option to be 

equipped with one or more weapons whose profiles are not 
listed on their datasheet. The profiles for these weapons are 
instead listed on this datacard.

Before selecting targets for this weapon, select one of its profiles to make attacks with.

ORKS
ARMY RULE

The infamous war cry of the Orks is known and 
feared throughout the galaxy. When it echoes across 
the battlefield, bellowed from hundreds or even 
thousands of greenskin mouths, even the most 
stalwart warriors fear the onslaught to come.

WAAAGH!
If your Army Faction is Orks, once per battle, at the 
start of the battle round, you can call a Waaagh! If you 
do, until the start of the next battle round:

 ■  Orks units from your army are eligible to declare a 

charge in a turn in which they Advanced.

 ■  Add 1 to the Strength and Attacks characteristics 

of melee weapons equipped by Orks models from 
your army. 

 ■  Orks models from your army have a 5+ 

invulnerable save.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Orks, you can use this 
Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule.

GET STUCK IN
Once an Ork gets stuck into hand-to-hand combat, 
they quickly overwhelm their enemies through 
sheer ferocity.

Melee weapons equipped by Orks models from your 
army have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Stratagems.

1CP

CAREEN!
WAAAGH! TRIBE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

If their vehicle is on its last legs, any Ork 
worth their steering wheel will aim its 
blazing remains into the nearest cluster 
of enemies. The ensuing explosions never 
fail to raise a rousing cheer from nearby 
Ork onlookers.

WHEN: Any phase, just after an Orks 
Vehicle unit from your army with the 
Deadly Demise ability is destroyed.
TARGET: That destroyed Orks Vehicle 
unit, if you roll a 6 for its Deadly Demise 
ability. You can use this Stratagem on that 
unit even though it was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Your unit can make a Normal or 
Fall Back move before its Deadly Demise 
ability is resolved, and before any 
embarked units perform an Emergency 
Disembarkation. When making this move, 
your unit can move over enemy units 
(excluding Monsters and Vehicles) as if 
they were not there.

ORKS IS NEVER BEATEN
WAAAGH! TRIBE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

2CP

So resilient is Ork physiology – and so 
slow are Orks on the uptake – that even 
killing wounds can take a while to register.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making attacks, 
and is then removed from play.

UNBRIDLED CARNAGE

WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

When Orks get stuck into the foe, the 
carnage is wonderful to behold, at least 
for other Orks.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army 
that has not been selected to fight 
this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an Orks model in your unit makes a 
melee attack, an unmodified hit roll of 5+ 
scores a Critical Hit.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Stratagems.

’ARD AS NAILS
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

MOB RULE
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Even the lowliest Ork Boy can take a 
tremendous amount of punishment before 
being slain.

1CP

The more Orks that gather in one place the 
more the Waaagh! energy flows, and the 
more fearless they all become.

1CP

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Orks unit from your army 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, subtract 
1 from the Wound roll.
RESTRICTIONS: You cannot select 
a Vehicle or Gretchin unit for 
this Stratagem. 

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Mob unit from your army that 
contains 10 or more models and is not 
Below Half-strength.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, while 
a friendly Orks Infantry unit is within 6" 
of that Mob unit, that Orks Infantry unit 
can still be selected as the target of your 
Stratagems even if it is Battle-shocked.

’ERE WE GO
WAAAGH! TRIBE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Even lumbering Orks can put on a 
surprising turn of speed when the promise 
of a good face-to-face fight is in the offing. 
Once a horde of Orks get a sight of the foe, 
nothing can stop them.

WHEN: Start of your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Orks Infantry unit from 
your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, add 2 
to Advance and Charge rolls made for 
your unit.

ORKS – WAAAGH! TRIBE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Waaagh! Tribe Detachment rule, you can use these Waaagh! Tribe Enhancements.
FOLLOW ME LADZ
Always found at the forefront of an assault, this Ork 
likes to be the first into the fray.

KUNNIN’ BUT BRUTAL
Feigning weakness, this greenskin allows his foes to 
close in before delivering a brutal flurry of attacks.

Orks model only. While the bearer is leading a 
unit, add 2" to the Move characteristic of models in 
that unit.
HEADWOPPA’S KILLCHOPPA
Grand Warboss Headwoppa and his tribe were last 
seen charging headlong into a horde of Khornate 
daemons, but legend speaks of a blood-slick choppa 
that still turns up occasionally. Though this weapon 
looks normal, a dark voice is said to growl in the mind 
of its wielder, driving them on to ever greater excesses 
of violence.

Orks model only. Melee weapons equipped by the 
bearer that do not have the [EXTRA ATTACKS] ability 
have the [DEVASTATING WOUNDS] ability.

Orks model only. While the bearer is leading a unit, 
that unit is eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a 
turn in which it Fell Back.
SUPA-CYBORK BODY
The original owner of this one-of-a-kind endoskeleton 
became the envy of every Warboss around, and was 
soon gutted and stripped for parts by a stronger 
rival. The Supa-Cybork Body has been retransplanted 
several times since then, filling its new owner with 
confidence, resilience and a belated hope that the 
Painboyz gave it a quick clean before shoving it back 
in place… 

Orks model only. The bearer has the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability.

BIG MEK IN MEGA ARMOUR
For all that its weight is akin to wearing half a tank, mega armour is 
incredibly resilient. Big Meks often build and wear it, adding unstable 
kustom weaponry, force field projectors, crushing klaws or even 
tellyport blastas that kill victims by beaming their component parts 
across a wide area, much to the Orks’ amusement.

The shokk attack gun opens a tunnel through the warp into its

The traditional tools of the Painboy help them to patch up even the

serve as an expedient means of dismembering the enemy with – if not 
surgical precision – at least a great deal of enthusiasm!

LEAGUES OF VOTANN
ARMY RULE

The Kin are a highly practical people in every area of life, not least in war. Their leaders make swift and careful 
calculations before and during battle, constantly striving to determine if the potential reward of conflict is worth 
the inevitable loss of resources and precious Kin lives. An essential part of this is what is known as casting the 
Eye of the Ancestors, through which Kin commanders assess the greatest enemy threats, mark weak points in 
their defences and determine what forces are needed to overcome both.

EYE OF THE ANCESTORS
If your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, each time 
an enemy unit destroys a Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army, that enemy unit gains 1 Judgement 
token. An enemy unit can never have more than 2 
Judgement tokens (any further Judgement tokens a 
unit would gain beyond this are ignored).

Each time a model from your army with this ability 
makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or 
more Judgement tokens, until that model’s attacks 
have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from 
the table below to that attack.

JUDGEMENT  

TOKENS

BONUS

1

2

Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.

Now We’ve Got a Grudge to Settle: 
Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the 
Wound roll.

Designer’s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is 
removed from the battlefield, make a note of how 
many Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. 
If that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place 
the corresponding number of Judgement tokens next 
to it. If a unit with Judgement tokens splits up into 
two or more smaller units, each of those units gains 
a number of Judgement tokens equal to that of the 
original unit. If two units combine to form a single 
larger unit and either of those units had Judgement 
tokens, make a note of how many the unit with the 
most has, just before they combine – the new unit 
has a number of Judgement tokens equal to this.

LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Leagues of Votann, you can 
use this Oathband Detachment rule.

RUTHLESS EFFICIENCY
The Kin of an Oathband are skilled warriors and 
ruthless expansionists, instinctively working together 
to defeat their foes and efficiently achieve their aims. 
As with everything, they approach war with a grim, 
methodical pragmatism that is an inspiration to 
other Kin.

At the start of the battle, select one unit from your 
opponent’s army. That unit starts the battle with 2 
Judgement tokens (see Eye of the Ancestors). 

If, at the start of any of your Command phases, that 
enemy unit is destroyed, you gain a number of CP 
depending on how early in the battle you destroyed 
it, as shown below (you can only gain CP in this way 
once per battle, and CP gained in this way are an 
exemption to the Core Rules that limit the maximum 
number of CP you can gain per battle round to 1).

Unit destroyed by the start of your first or second 
Command phase:

You gain

1CP

1CP

WARRIOR PRIDE
OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The warriors of the Leagues of Votann 
pride themselves on their martial skill 
and proficiency in combat, and when the 
Ancestors are watching their actions they 
can quickly overwhelm and pick apart 
their foes.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army, and one enemy unit 
that has one or more Judgement tokens 
and is within Engagement Range of that 
Leagues of Votann unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes 
a melee attack that targets that enemy 
unit, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1 for each 
Judgement token that enemy unit has.

ORDERED RETREAT
OATHBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Not for the Kin the sudden panic of the 
rout. Instead, they fall back steadily 
and by squads, laying down furious 
suppressing fire before launching 
fresh assaults.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after a 
Leagues of Votann unit from your army 
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Leagues of Votann unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to shoot and declare a charge.

1CP

ANCESTRAL SENTENCE
OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

Some foes are so loathed that the 
Ancestors themselves are said to pass 
sentence upon them, marking them 
for death.

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes 
a ranged attack, that attack has the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability, and each time 
a model in your unit makes a ranged 
attack that targets a unit that has one or 
more Judgement tokens, that attack has 
the [SUSTAINED HITS 2] ability instead.

REACTIVE REPRISAL

OATHBAND – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

2CP

Once an enemy target has been marked out 
by the Eye of the Ancestors, the Kin focus their 
efforts upon its destruction, redoubling their 
fury should it attempt to engage.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, just 
after an enemy unit that has one or more 
Judgement tokens has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit from 
your army that was selected as the target of 
one or more of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your Leagues of Votann unit can 
shoot as if it were your Shooting phase, but it 
must target the enemy unit that just attacked 
it, and can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target.

LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Stratagems.

1CP

NEWFOUND NEMESIS
OATHBAND – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

To strike down Kin is to earn the 
immediate and murderous ire of all their 
warrior comrades.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has resolved its attacks.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann 
Infantry or Leagues of Votann 
Mounted unit from your army that was 
reduced to Below Half-strength as a result 
of the attacking unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: The attacking unit gains 1 
Judgement token, or up to 2 Judgement 
tokens instead if that Leagues of Votann 
unit contained your Warlord when it was 
targeted by those attacks.

1CP

VOID ARMOUR
OATHBAND – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Void armour comprises hardened, 
jointed segments hooked into the 
void suit beneath. It is fashioned from 
magnaferrite weave, and often reinforced 
with adamantine and enhanced with 
microfield generators.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Leagues of Votann unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your Leagues 
of Votann unit, worsen the Armour 
Penteration characteristic of that attack 
by 1.

LEAGUES OF VOTANN – OATHBAND
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Oathband Detachment rule, you can use these Oathband Enhancements.
APPRAISING GLARE
Few Kin can cast the Eye of the Ancestors with the 
swiftness and grim efficiency of this venerable leader. 
Where their merciless gaze falls, the strengths and 
weaknesses of the enemy are laid bare, and there 
their warriors strike hardest.

GRIM DEMEANOUR
This warlord’s grim countenance is legendary, and 
they are rumoured to have never smiled. Such a 
demeanour is, of course, an outward sign of how 
seriously they undertake their solemn tasks, and 
under their stern gaze no Kin will be found wanting.

Leagues of Votann model only. In your Command 
phase, you can select one objective marker your 
opponent controls. Until the end of the phase, while 
an enemy unit is within range of that objective marker, 
it counts as having one more Judgement token than it 
actually has (to a maximum of 2).
A LONG LIST
This warrior holds the majority of the galaxy’s races 
in contempt, and seeks out their many nemeses with 
a keen and inescapable eye. No sooner have they 
settled a Grudge against one foe, than they move to 
the next name on their list.

Leagues of Votann model only. Each time the 
bearer’s unit destroys an enemy unit, if that enemy 
unit has one or more Judgement tokens, you can 
select one other enemy unit that is visible to the 
bearer. That other unit gains one Judgement token.

Leagues of Votann model only. You can re-roll 
Battle-shock tests taken for the bearer’s unit, and 
models in that unit can ignore any or all modifiers to 
their characteristics and/or to any rolls or tests made 
for them (excluding modifiers to saving throws).
WAYFARER’S GRACE
This one-of-a-kind void suit was crafted for the 
famed Hernkyn adventurer Sîmmka Farstryd as 
thanks for her saving the Hold world of Hyvôk’s 
Kindred. Incorporating ancient technological secrets 
interpreted from Votannic lore, Wayfarer’s Grace acts 
as a life-support system for its wearer. Monitoring 
their vital statistics constantly, the suit provides 
medical support and can even restart its wearer’s 
stopped heart in extremis.

Leagues of Votann model only. The first time the 
bearer is destroyed, after placing a Judgement token 
next to the unit that destroyed it, roll one D6 at the 
end of the phase. On a 2+, set the bearer back up on 
the battlefield as close as possible to where it was 
destroyed and not within Engagement Range of any 
enemy units, with its full wounds remaining.

ADEPTUS CUSTODES – SHIELD HOST
ARMY RULE

Created deep in the Emperor’s Palace using esoteric gene-
alchemies and other, even more mysterious processes, 
the warriors of the Adeptus Custodes are the Emperor’s 
personal bodyguards. Known as the Ten Thousand, they 
are the most elite warriors in the entire Imperium, and 
are armed and armoured to match. In battle, they deploy 
highly flexible fighting forces, from peerless infantry and 
lightning-fast jetbikes to indomitable combat walkers and 
line-shattering battle tanks. It is in melee combat that they 
truly excel, however, each warrior having mastered the 
nuanced and subtle fighting stances designed to dominate 
the Custodians’ many enemies.

MARTIAL KA’TAH
At the start of the Fight phase, select one Ka’tah Stance 
from the list below to be active for your army until the 
end of the phase. While a Ka’tah Stance is active for your 
army, each unit from your army with this ability gains the 
relevant ability.

KAPTARIS STANCE
Kaptaris is optimised to trap enemy units in close 
combat with the Custodes, where the elite warriors can 
eliminate them.

Each time a melee attack targets this unit, subtract 1 from 
the Hit roll.

DACATARAI STANCE
This aggressive fighting style has been adapted for 
the Custodes to deal with hordes of foes who vastly 
outnumber them. 

Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

RENDAX STANCE
Masters of Rendax are superlative monster and war-
machine hunters. 

Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit have the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

ADEPTUS CUSTODES – SHIELD HOST
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Custodes, you can 
use this Shield Host Detachment rule.

AEGIS OF THE EMPEROR
The cellular alchemy that creates the warriors of the 
Adeptus Custodes leaves them forever touched by a 
spark of the Emperor’s own greatness. Beyond their 
martial might and incorruptible nobility, this energy 
manifests itself as an almost supernatural warding, 
as though the Custodians were protected by the hand 
of the Emperor.

Adeptus Custodes models from your army have the 
Feel No Pain 4+ ability against mortal wounds.

ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Shield Host Detachment rule, you can use these Shield Host Enhancements.
UNSTOPPABLE DESTROYER
This warrior is implacable on the field, the Emperor’s 
will made manifest. No foe can hope to stop him 
achieving his goals, and those who stand before his 
battle fury see their death swiftly approaching.

VEILED BLADE
An ancient weapon that burns with a bitterly cold 
and dark energy, the Veiled Blade is bestowed upon 
a Custodian who has vowed to recover that which 
should remain hidden from Humanity, and return it to 
the Dark Cells.

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). Each time the bearer 
ends a Charge move, select one enemy unit within 
Engagement Range of the bearer and roll one D6: on 
a 2-5, that enemy unit suffers D3 mortal wounds; on 
a 6, that enemy unit suffers 3 mortal wounds.

 ■  Once per battle, after the bearer’s unit ends a Charge 

move, all enemy units within 6" of the bearer must 
take a Battle-shock test.
INSPIRATIONAL EXEMPLAR
This warrior epitomises the martial genius of the 
Adeptus Custodes. His judgement is sound, his 
tactical acumen impeccable.

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). The bearer has a 
Leadership characteristic of 5+.

 ■  Once per battle, at the start of any phase, you can 
select one friendly Adeptus Custodes unit that is 
Battle-shocked and within 12" of the bearer; that 
unit is no longer Battle-shocked. 

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). Add 2 to the Attacks 
characteristic of the bearer’s melee weapons.

 ■  Once per battle, at the start of any Command phase, 

triple the bearer’s Objective Control characteristic 
until the end of the turn.
CEASELESS HUNTER
This warrior never relents in the pursuit of his quarry 
– any apparent withdrawal he makes merely brings 
death to his foe sooner.

 ■  Adeptus Custodes model only (excluding 

Anathema Psykana models). The bearer’s unit is 
eligible to shoot and declare a charge in a turn in 
which it Fell Back.

 ■  Once per battle, when an enemy unit ends a Normal, 

Advance or Fall Back move within 9" of the bearer, 
if the bearer’s unit is not within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units, it can make a Normal 
move of up to 6".

impenetrable suit of auramite Terminator armour, they become more 
powerful still – a walking fortress of Imperial might able to teleport 
directly into battle in a blaze of golden light.

DREADBLADES 
Dreadblades often wander the galaxy, carving 
a path of destruction and slaughtering foes 
alongside other forces of Chaos as and when 
they will.

If every model in your army has the Chaos 
keyword, you can include either 1 Titanic 
Chaos Knights model or up to 3 War Dog 
models in your army, even if they do not have 
the Faction keyword you selected in the Select 
Army Faction step. None of these models 
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be 
given Enhancements. 

CHAOS KNIGHTS
ARMY RULES

Where Chaos Knights tread, the skies grow 
unnaturally dark and the dread of the warp permeates 
the battlefield. None are immune to its shadowy 
touch, for those it does not paralyse with fear 
and despair are wracked with hallucinations and 
driven mad.

HARBINGERS OF DREAD
If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, each model 
from your army with this ability gains a bonus 
depending on which Dread abilities are active for 
your army (see below). Once a Dread ability is active 
for your army, that ability applies until the end of 
the battle.

BATTLE ROUND  1  ONWARDS

From the first battle round onwards, the Despair 
ability is active for your army:

DESPAIR (AURA)
While an enemy unit is within 12" of this model, 
each time that enemy unit takes a Battle-shock or 
Leadership test, subtract 1 from that test.

BATTLE ROUND  3  ONWARDS

From the third battle round onwards, the Doom and 
Darkness ability is active for your army:

DOOM AND DARKNESS
 ■  Each time this model makes an attack, if the target 

is Battle-shocked, add 1 to the Wound roll. 

 ■  Each time an attack targets this model, if the 

attacking model’s unit is Battle-shocked, subtract 1 
from the Hit roll. 

SUPER-HEAVY WALKER
Each time a model with this ability makes a Normal, 
Advance or Fall Back move, it can move over models 
(excluding Titanic models) and terrain features that 
are 4" or less in height as if they were not there.

CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Chaos Knights, you can use 
this Traitoris Lance Detachment rule.

FORGED IN TERROR (AURA)
Chaos Knights are servants of shadow and terror; 
wherever they stride, fear and madness spread. 

In the Battle-shock step of your opponent’s Command 
phase, if an enemy unit that is below its Starting 
Strength is within 12" of a Chaos Knights model 
from your army, that enemy unit must take a Battle-
shock test. For the purposes of this ability, if a unit 
has a Starting Strength of 1, it is considered to be 
below its Starting Strength while it has lost one or 
more wounds.

Designer’s Note: This means that all enemy units 
within range of this Aura ability that have lost one or 
more models must take a Battle-shock test in your 
opponent’s Command phase, not just those that are 
Below Half-strength.

CHAOS KNIGHTS – TRAITORIS LANCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Enhancements. 
LORD OF DREAD
This tyrannical Knight is the epitome of dread power, 
instilling as much fear in their minions as they do over 
the enemy, ensuring unwavering obedience.

THE TRAITOR’S MARK
The dark deeds and bloodstained heraldry of this 
Chaos Knight are whispered far and wide. Rumours 
spread that to confront it is to face a painful death. 
Each blazon borne upon its hull proclaims the unholy 
atrocities committed by the bearer, and even to look 
upon these loathsome sigils is to be gripped by 
unnatural terror and beset by swarming nightmares.

Chaos Knights model only. At the start of the 
Fight phase, you can select one enemy unit within 
Engagement Range of the bearer; that enemy unit 
must take a Battle-shock test.
AURA OF TERROR
This towering Knight is wreathed in tendrils of warp 
energy that caress the minds of any enemy who 
draws near, driving those touched into a state of 
abject fear. Wherever this Knight treads, this aura of 
terror permeates and corrupts the land until it can 
be cleansed.

Chaos Knights model only. If you control an 
objective marker at the end of your Command phase, 
and the bearer is within range of that objective 
marker, that objective marker is said to be Tainted 
and remains under your control even if you have no 
models within range of it, until your opponent controls 
it at the start or end of any turn. In addition, while an 
objective marker is Tainted and under your control 
and the Despair Dread ability is active for your army, 
that objective marker has the Despair Dread ability as 
if it was a Chaos Knights model from your army (so 
subtract 1 from Battle-shock and Leadership tests 
taken for enemy units within 12" of it).

Chaos Knights model only. The Doom and Darkness 
ability is active for the bearer from the first battle 
round onwards, instead of from the third. 
PANOPLY OF THE CURSED KNIGHTS
Borne within an unmarked casket by an order of 
silent Idolators, this collection of tattered pennants, 
chain-strung charms and armour scraps represent 
the last remains of the Knight Carnivus Grymm. It 
is said that festooning one’s Knight suit with these 
charms instils the legendary fortitude of that doomed 
war engine. Yet it is whispered that doing so also 
invites the attentions of the same dread curse that 
eventually led to Carnivus Grymm’s ghastly end.

Chaos Knights model only. Each time an attack is 
made against the bearer, subtract 1 from the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of that attack.

STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Traitoris Lance Detachment rule, you can use these Traitoris Lance Stratagems. 

1CP

DREAD HOUNDS
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

War Dog pilots encircle their terrified 
victims then attack in a ferocious mass.

WHEN: The start of your Shooting phase or 
the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two or more War Dog units from 
your army and one enemy unit that is an 
eligible target for each of those selected 
War Dog units.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
the selected War Dog units can only 
target that enemy unit, but all weapons 
equipped by those War Dog models gain 
the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability. In addition, 
if that enemy unit is Battle-shocked, until 
the end of the phase, each time a selected 
War Dog model makes an attack against 
that enemy unit, an unmodified Hit roll of 
5+ scores a Critical Hit.

1CP

PTERRORSHADES
TRAITORIS LANCE – WARGEAR STRATAGEM

Shrieking with ghoulish hunger, daemonic 
entities descend in a tatterwinged 
whirlwind to rend apart the souls of those 
enemies who show even a moment’s fear. 
The soul-raptors tear apart their victims’ 
animus and, as they feed, this life force 
is channelled to regenerate the battle 
damage or heal the pilot of the Knight in 
which these creatures roost.

WHEN: Any phase, just after an enemy 
unit fails a Battle-shock test.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from 
your army that is within 12" of that 
enemy unit.
EFFECT: Roll six D6. For each 4+, that 
enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound and 
this model regains up to 1 lost wound. 

DISDAIN FOR THE WEAK
TRAITORIS LANCE – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

Chaos Knight pilots refuse to yield while 
foes remain to be slain, disdainfully 
ignoring those who succumb to fear.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Chaos Knights unit from 
your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, your 
model has the Feel No Pain 6+ ability, and 
the Feel No Pain 5+ ability against attacks 
made by Battle-shocked models.

A LONG LEASH
TRAITORIS LANCE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The War Dogs of the Chaos Knights are 
more terrified of their lords than they 
are the enemy, and they heed their 
masters well, for they know the price of 
disobedience or disloyalty.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Abhorrent model from your 
army and up to three War Dog models 
from your army.
EFFECT: Until the start of your next 
Command phase, those War Dog models 
count as being within range of any Aura 
abilities that Abhorrent model has.

KNIGHTS OF SHADE
TRAITORIS LANCE – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Like dark phantoms, some Chaos 
Knights can move through solid walls 
without hindrance.

WHEN: Your Movement phase or your 
Charge phase.
TARGET: Up to two War Dog models from 
your army or one Titanic Chaos Knights 
model from your army.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, the 
selected models can move horizontally 
through models and terrain features as if 
they were not there.

WAR DOG BRIGAND
Between them, Brigands and their Fallen Noble pilots have become 
so enamoured of the skilful, ranged kill that they mostly disdain the 
chaos of close assaults. Some even swear dark pacts compelling them 
to slay potent foes with elegance, or else to purge war zones of all life 
with sweeping contempt.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS 
ARMY RULE

An Adeptus Mechanicus army marching to war is a sight 
both terrifying and glorious, each holy warrior a disturbing 
fusion of Human and machine. While the ruling Tech-
Priests and their fanatical followers raise modified voices 
in praise of the Machine God, their Skitarii soldiery and 
Servitor creations are controlled by doctrina imperatives 
loaded by their masters to augment and adapt the 
warriors’ abilities.

DOCTRINA IMPERATIVES
At the start of the battle round, you can select one of the 
Doctrina Imperatives below. Until the end of the battle 
round, that Doctrina Imperative is active for your army, and 
all units from your army that have the Doctrina Imperatives 
ability gain the relevant abilities shown below.

PROTECTOR IMPERATIVE
 ■  Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have 

the [HEAVY] ability.

 ■   Each time a ranged attack targets this unit, if this unit 
is within your deployment zone, worsen the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.

CONQUEROR IMPERATIVE
 ■  Ranged weapons equipped by models in this unit have 

the [ASSAULT] ability.

 ■   Each time a model in this unit makes a ranged attack, 

if the target of that attack is within your opponent's 
deployment zone, improve the Armour Penetration 
characteristic of that attack by 1.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Mechanicus, you can use 
this Rad-Cohort Detachment rule.

RAD-BOMBARDMENT
Whether as a result of natural phenomena, apocalyptic 
internecine strife or calamitous accidents, many forge 
worlds are heavily irradiated. When holy wars of requisition 
are unleashed, the Tech-Priests think nothing of turning 
this invisible curse upon their foes, bombarding the 
battlefield with deadly radiation prior to an assault.

BATTLE ROUND  1  

BOMBARDMENT
At the start of the first battle round, for each enemy unit 
within your opponent's deployment zone, your opponent 
must decide whether that unit will take cover or stand firm. 
If a unit takes cover, until the end of the battle round, that 
unit is Battle-shocked. If a unit stands firm, roll one D6 for 
that unit: on a 3+, that unit suffers D3 mortal wounds.

BATTLE ROUND  2 ONWARDS

FALLOUT
At the start of the second, third, fourth and fifth battle 
rounds, roll one D6 for each enemy unit within your 
opponent's deployment zone. On a 3+, that unit suffers 1 
mortal wound.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT

A haze of deadly radiation hangs around 
the warriors of a Rad-Cohort, every 
exhalation they make adding to the 
isotopic fog, sapping the strength and 
stamina of those who are not inured to 
its effects.

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus unit 
from your army (excluding Vehicle units) 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, each 
time an attack is made that targets your 
unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll. 

EXTINCTION ORDER

RAD-COHORT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

As Tech-Priests order the purge of an area 
of the battlefield, rad-bombardments are 
redoubled in the hopes of turning it into 
a wasteland.

WHEN: Your Command phase.
TARGET: One Tech-Priest model from 
your army and one objective marker 
within 24" of that model.
EFFECT: Roll one D6 for each enemy unit 
within range of that objective marker. On a 
4+, that unit suffers 1 mortal wound and it 
must take a Battle-shock test. 

2CP

WHEN: Your Shooting phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus 
unit from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
ranged attack that targets an enemy unit 
(excluding Vehicle units), add 1 to the 
Wound roll.

AGGRESSOR IMPERATIVE

RAD-COHORT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The Skitarii feel the press of an invisible 
hand upon their minds as the Machine 
God drives them forward. Servos are 
pushed to their structural limits as fibre 
bundles fill with the boundless energy of 
the Motive Force and propel the faithful on 
an unstoppable crusade.

WHEN: Your Charge phase.
TARGET: One Skitarii unit from your army 
that Advanced this turn.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to declare a charge even though 
it Advanced this turn.
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem if the Conqueror Imperative is 
active for your army.

VENGEFUL FALLOUT
RAD-COHORT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The sentence for those who dare strike 
at the Tech-Priests' holy creations has 
been carefully prepared in advance and 
it can be unleashed with an anger born of 
fanatical faith.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has resolved 
its attacks.
TARGET: One Adeptus Mechanicus unit 
from your army that was selected as 
the target of one or more of that enemy 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Your unit can shoot as if it were 
your Shooting phase, but it must target 
only that enemy unit when doing so, and 
it can only do so if that enemy unit is an 
eligible target. After your unit has finished 
making these attacks, it is not eligible to 
shoot again this turn.

BULWARK IMPERATIVE
RAD-COHORT – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The warrior wisdom of experienced 
Reductors is force-loaded into the Skitarii’s

the Tech-Priests’ soldiers.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Skitarii unit from your army 
that was selected as the target of one or 
more of that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, models 
in your unit have a 4+ invulnerable save. 
RESTRICTIONS: You can only use this 
Stratagem if the Protector Imperative is 
active for your army.

ADEPTUS MECHANICUS – RAD-COHORT

If you are using the Rad-Cohort Detachment rule, you can use these Rad-Cohort Enhancements.
ARCHIVED PURGE PROTOCOLS
Having witnessed the rad-bombardment of a hundred 
battlefields, this experienced commander can call 
upon the minutiae of those servo-recorded conflicts, 
feeding adjusted protocols into the data-nets of their 
warriors, granting them a hyper-predictive combat 
awareness to perfectly defeat the foe as they stumble 
out from their irradiated positions.

MASTER ANNIHILATOR
With a mind blissfully unsullied by the passions 
common to the flesh, this zealot has become 
a peerless annihilator, commanding ruthless 
technology to eliminate all life before them. So 
blessed, they impart the detached logic of their 
priorities unto their minions.

Skitarii Marshal model only. At the start of the

unit within 12" of the bearer. Until the start of the next 
battle round, if the Protector Imperative is active for 
your army, the Conqueror Imperative is active for that

ARMY RULE

VOICE OF COMMAND
Raised and trained to instil unwavering obedience, officers 
of the Imperial Guard command authority and respect, and 
issue orders with imperious bellows that cut through the 
clamour of war.

If your Army Faction is Astra Militarum, in your 
Command phase, Officer models from your army with 
this ability can issue Orders. Each Officer’s datasheet 
will specify how many Orders it can issue and which units 
are eligible to receive those Orders. Each time an Officer 
model issues an Order, select one of the Orders below, 
then select one eligible friendly unit within 6" of that 
Officer model to issue it to. 

Until the start of your next Command phase, the unit 
you selected is affected by that Order. Unless otherwise 
stated, a unit can only be affected by one Order at a time 
(any Order subsequently issued to that unit replaces the 
current one). If a unit being affected by an Order becomes 
Battle-shocked, that Order ceases to affect that unit.

MOVE! MOVE! MOVE!
Add 3" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.

FIX BAYONETS!

equipped by models in this unit by 1.

ASTRA MILITARUM – COMBINED REGIMENT
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Astra Militarum, you can use 
this Combined Regiment Detachment rule.

BORN SOLDIERS
Regiments of numerous origins and tactical roles 
inculcate their soldiers from an early age with the 
legendary doctrines of the Tactica Imperium. Infantry 
and tank crews are drilled in close-range fire patterns 
in the expectation of being thrust into the front lines.

Each time an Astra Militarum unit from your army 
Remains Stationary, until the end of the turn, ranged 
weapons equipped by models in that unit have the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

ASTRA MILITARUM – COMBINED REGIMENT
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Combined Regiment Detachment rule, you can use these Combined 
Regiment Enhancements.
DEATH MASK OF OLLANIUS
Ollanius the Pious is the epitome of Imperial 
sainthood, believed martyred at the hands of Horus 
himself. His death mask is a terrifying piece of 
craftsmanship, depicting in obsidian and void-fired 
bronze the agonised visage of a tortured angel. 
In the millennia since his passing, Ollanius’ death 
mask has been revered as a holy relic; loyal soldiers 
in the ancient artefact’s presence are granted the 
determination of the famous martyr himself.

KUROV’S AQUILA
General Kurov was one of the most gifted officers 
in Imperial history. Upon retirement, he recorded 
dozens of tactical treatises that were translated into 
vox-ghosts and uploaded into a two-headed avian 
servitor referred to as Kurov’s Aquila. An officer who 
possesses this prestigious tool can turn to it for 
guidance. In response, the servitor’s blindfolded 
head will vocalise the most relevant vox-ghost in 
Kurov’s commanding tones, lecturing its owner on 
counter-tactics. The other head’s eyes glow above its 
bound-shut beak as they project a hololithic display 
of Kurov himself, his image flickering as it reveals the 
manoeuvres of wars long past.

Officer model only. While the bearer’s unit is 
Battle-shocked, subtract 1 from the Objective Control 
characteristic of models in that unit, instead of 
changing it to 0. 
DRILL COMMANDER
Expertly guiding their elite soldiers’ fire, this officer’s 
stentorian orders reinforce years of indoctrinated 
drills concerning the relentless application of 
accurate long-range volleys.

Officer model only. While the bearer is leading a 
unit, each time a model in that unit makes a ranged 
attack, if that unit Remained Stationary this turn, a 
Critical Hit is scored on a successful unmodified Hit 
roll of 5+.

Officer model only. Once per battle, just after your 
opponent has used a Stratagem, the bearer can use 
this Enhancement. If it does, until the end of the 
battle, the CP cost your opponent must pay to use that 
Stratagem again is increased by 1CP.
GRAND STRATEGIST 
Having commanded troops on countless battlefields, 
this veteran officer has borne witness to the manifold 
caprices of war. They have perfected just as many 
strategic responses, and bark out a constant stream 
of rapidly evolving orders as the situation demands.

Officer model only. In your Command phase, the 
bearer can issue one additional Order.

TARGET: One Astra Militarum Infantry 
unit from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot this phase, and one 
enemy unit (excluding Monsters 
and Vehicles).
EFFECT: If your Astra Militarum unit

enemy unit this phase, until the end of 
your opponent’s next turn, each time 
a model in that enemy unit makes an 
attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll.

2CP

REINFORCEMENTS!
COMBINED REGIMENT – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Astra Militarum can call upon a nearly 
inexhaustible supply of warriors.

was just destroyed.
EFFECT: Add a new unit to your army 
identical to your destroyed unit, in 
Strategic Reserves, at its Starting Strength 
and with all of its wounds remaining. 
RESTRICTIONS: This Stratagem cannot

TARGET: One Regiment or Squadron 
unit from your army that has not been 
selected to shoot this phase.
EFFECT: After your unit has resolved its 
attacks, select one enemy unit that was 
targeted by one or more of those attacks. 
Until the end of the phase, each time an 
attack is made against that enemy unit 
by a Regiment or Squadron model from 
your army, unless the attacking unit 
is Battle-shocked, improve the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of that attack 
by 1.

armoured not only in reinforced 
plas-steel, but with devout faith in the 
Emperor and utter contempt for their foes.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase, 
just after an enemy unit has selected 
its targets.
TARGET: One Astra Militarum Vehicle 
unit from your army that was selected as 
the target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack is allocated to your unit, 
subtract 1 from the Damage characteristic 
of that attack.

LEMAN RUSS ERADICATOR
The nova cannon carried by Leman Russ Eradicators fires shells 
containing a sub-atomic core. Their detonations produce powerful 
shock waves that pulverise enemy barricades and the infantry 
sheltering behind them. This battle tank is therefore a mainstay in the 
dense confines of urban firefights.

BANEHAMMER
Where the Banehammer excels is as a defensive anchor in the 
Imperial Guard’s formations. Those enemies not blasted apart by its 
tremor cannon’s shells are brought to a crawl as the ground splits 
beneath them. The stunned foe is then forced to push slowly forward 
beneath a further barrage, or else retreat in disarray.

DEATHWATCH
ARMY RULES

From their hidden bases in orbiting watch fortresses, the Deathwatch dispatch carefully selected operatives to 
hunt down and exterminate alien presences wherever they may be found. Each of these post-human warriors 
is a veteran of countless battles, tithed by their original Chapter to undertake the Long Vigil and guard against 
alien incursion. 

KILL TEAMS
When faced with an array of missions to complete 
and varying enemies to lay low, the Deathwatch are 
highly adept at forming effective kill teams that mesh 
starkly diverse armour and equipment.

Each time an attack targets a Kill Team unit from 
your army that contains models with different 
Toughness characteristics, until the attacking unit 
has finished making its attacks, use the Toughness 
characteristic of the majority of the models in that 
unit when determining what roll is required for 
that attack to successfully wound. If two or more 
Toughness characteristics are tied for majority, use 
the highest value. 

For the purposes of determining which models 
can embark within a Transport model, Kill Team 
Terminator models, Kill Team Outrider models, Kill 
Team Biker models and models equipped with a jump 
pack each take up the space of 2 models, but can 
otherwise embark within any Transport their unit 
can embark within, even though similar models in 
other units may have the Terminator, Mounted or 
Jump Pack keywords. 

For the purposes of interacting with terrain features, 
all models in units with the Kill Team ability are 
treated as Infantry, even though similar models 
in other units may have the Mounted or Jump 
Pack keywords.

Designer’s Note: While the slight abstractions in the above 
rules cause some models to behave differently to similar 
models in other units, they are designed to minimise unusual 
or complicated movement, Transport and Benefit of 
Cover effects.

DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE 
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule. 

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army can include Deathwatch units, but it 

cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn 
from any other Chapter.

 ■  Your army cannot include any of the following units: 
Assault Squad; Assault Squad with Jump Packs; 
Attack Bike Squad; Devastator Squad; Land 
Speeder Storm; Scout Squad; Scout Sniper 
Squad; Tactical Squad.

MISSION TACTICS
Thousands of years of collated strategic data and 
hard-won combat experience have provided the 
Deathwatch with the ultimate battlefield tactics to 
combat almost any foe.

At the start of your Command phase, you can select 
one of the Mission Tactics listed below. Until the start 
of your next Command phase, that Mission Tactic 
is active and its effects apply to all units from your 
army with this ability. Each Mission Tactic can only be 
selected once per battle.

FUROR TACTICS
When the enemy horde grows close, the Deathwatch 
will be tasked with the decimation of their core. 
Aiming not for clinical kills but for maximum 
destruction over a wide area, they tear the heart from 
the enemy army.

While this Mission Tactic is active, weapons equipped 
by Adeptus Astartes units from your army have the 
[SUSTAINED HITS 1] ability.

MALLEUS TACTICS
When the giants of war lumber forth, the Deathwatch 
will adopt Malleus tactics. Even the largest behemoth 
has a weak point, and the archives of the Deathwatch 
number them all.

While this Mission Tactic is active, weapons equipped 
by Adeptus Astartes units from your army have the 
[LETHAL HITS] ability.

PURGATUS TACTICS
By adopting Purgatus tactics, the Deathwatch focus 
their deadly ire upon the commanders of the enemy 
host, assassinating them one after another with 
pitiless head shots and killing thrusts of the blade. 

While this Mission Tactic is active, each time an 
Adeptus Astartes unit from your army makes an 
attack, if a Critical Hit is scored, that attack has the 
[PRECISION] ability.

DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE

If you are using the Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Black Spear Task 
Force Stratagems.

physiologies of the Adeptus Astartes make 
them unyielding foes.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.

units that are within Engagement Range of 
one or more enemy units.

ADAPTIVE TACTICS

from your army, or one other Adeptus 
Astartes unit your army.
EFFECT: For each unit targeted, select the 
Furor Tactics, Malleus Tactics or Purgatus

Command phase, that Mission Tactic is 
active for that unit instead of any Mission

DEATHWATCH – BLACK SPEAR TASK FORCE
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Black Spear Task Force Detachment rule, you can use these Black Spear Task 
Force Enhancements. 
THIEF OF SECRETS
The Thief of Secrets is a blade whose machine 
spirit has an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. 
It has tasted the vitae of countless alien races, 
absorbing those liquids through auto-sanctified 
sanguinator-channels and codifying them through 
the honeycombed array of logicum cells within. The 
biological secrets of many xenos races have thus 
been laid bare, allowing the blade’s user to modulate 
its power field, the better to slice through chitinous 
armour, rupture xenoform organs and burn out alien 
nervous systems.

BEACON ANGELIS
The Beacon Angelis was devised to guide the 
Deathwatch to the threshold of the alien adversary. 
Housed within a reliquary, it calls out to the warriors’ 
augur arrays with the voices of a hundred electric 
cherubim, its summons so strong that it draws the 
righteous unto its locale regardless of what darkness 
may surround it.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Models in the bearer’s 
unit have the Deep Strike ability. In addition, you 
can target the bearer’s unit with the Rapid Ingress 
Stratagem for 0CP.
THE TOME OF ECTOCLADES
This grimoire, bound in the skin of the alien, holds 
the most powerful truths the Deathwatch have 
uncovered about their foes, whether xenos or those 
who harbour them. On occasion, such knowledge has 
been known to save not only the book’s custodian, 
but entire worlds.

Watch Master or Captain model only. Once per 
battle, after you have selected an enemy unit using 
the Oath of Moment ability in your Command phase, 
the bearer can use this Enhancement if they are on 
the battlefield. When they do, select a second enemy 
unit – until the start of your next Command phase, 
each time an Adeptus Astartes model from your 
army makes an attack that targets either of those 
enemy units, you can re-roll the Hit roll and you can 
re-roll the Wound roll.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Improve the Strength, 
Damage and Armour Penetration characteristics of 
the bearer’s melee weapons by 1. If an enemy model 
is destroyed as the result of a melee attack made by 
the bearer, at the end of that phase, until the end of 
the battle, improve the Strength, Damage and Armour 
Penetration characteristics of the bearer’s melee 
weapons by 2 instead.
OSSEUS KEY
The ancient clavis known as the Osseus Key is said 
to be the most powerful of its kind. Where other such 
devices are made from sanctified platinum, the 
Osseus Key is made from the hand and finger bones 
of deceased Imperial Fists heroes that fought in the 
Horus Heresy, scrimshawed with inhuman care and 
imbued with the fiercest machine spirits of the age. 
No portal can bar its bearer from entry, and no xenos 
machine can stand before his wrath.

Watch Master or Techmarine model only. At the 
start of your opponent’s Shooting phase, select one 
enemy Vehicle unit (excluding Titanic units) within 
12" of and visible to the bearer. That model must take 
a Leadership test. If that test is passed, until the end 
of the phase, each time a model in that unit makes an 
attack, subtract 1 from the Hit roll; if that test is failed, 
that unit is not eligible to shoot this phase.

BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
DETACHMENT RULE

Gene-sons of the angel-winged Primarch Sanguinius, the Blood Angels descend into battle on flaming wings to 
stand between the Emperor’s servants and the heretical and alien hordes that seek to destroy them. Masters 
of the rapid assault, the mechanised offensive and the swift airborne strike, they have carved out a legacy of 
victories that stretches across the ages.

If your Army Faction is Adeptus Astartes, you can 
use this Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule.

RESTRICTIONS
 ■  Your army can include Blood Angels units, but it 
cannot include any Adeptus Astartes units drawn 
from any other Chapter.

THE RED THIRST
Though they strive to restrain it, the murderous 
ferocity of the Blood Angels simmers beneath the 
surface of their thoughts. In battle, this rage drives 
them towards the foe and lends great strength to 
their blows.

Each time an Adeptus Astartes unit from your 
army is selected to fight, if that unit made a Charge 
move this turn, until the end of the phase, add 1 to 
the Strength and Attacks characteristics of melee 
weapons equipped by models in that unit.

BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
STRATAGEMS

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of 
Sanguinius Stratagems.

1CP

1CP

ANGEL’S SACRIFICE
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

The Blood Angels would gladly put 
themselves in harm’s way to protect 
others, exemplifying the sacrifice 
of Sanguinius.

WHEN: Any phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes 
Character unit from your army that 
was just destroyed. You can use this 
Stratagem on that unit even though it was 
just destroyed.
EFFECT: Until the end of the battle, each 
time a friendly Adeptus Astartes unit 
makes an attack that targets the enemy 
unit that just destroyed your Character 
unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll.

ARMOUR OF CONTEMPT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

The belligerency of the Adeptus Astartes 
combined with their transhuman 
physiology makes them unyielding foes 
to face.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time an attack targets your unit, worsen 
the Armour Penetration characteristic of 
that attack by 1.

AGGRESSIVE ONSLAUGHT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

1CP

The Sons of Sanguinius constantly 
push towards new foes, the bloodlust 
singing in their veins unleashed in a 
controlled dynamism.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes 
unit from your army, just before that 
unit Consolidates.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
each time a model in your unit makes a 
Consolidation move, it can move up to 
6" instead of up to 3", provided your unit 
ends that Consolidation move in Unit 
Coherency and within Engagement Range 
of one or more enemy units.

RED RAMPAGE
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – BATTLE TACTIC STRATAGEM

In times of great desperation, fury and 
ferocity can be a warrior’s strongest allies.

WHEN: Fight phase.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit from 
your army that has not been selected to 
fight this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, 
melee weapons equipped by models 
in your unit have the [LANCE] and 
[LETHAL HITS] abilities.

ONLY IN DEATH DOES DUTY END

SONS OF SANGUINIUS – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

2CP

Imminent death does not prevent a Space 
Marine from enacting his final justice 
upon the enemies of the Imperium.

1CP

WHEN: Fight phase, just after an enemy 
unit has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Adeptus Astartes unit 
from your army that was selected as the 
target of one or more of the attacking 
unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a model in your unit is destroyed, if 
that model has not fought this phase, do 
not remove it from play. The destroyed 
model can fight after the attacking 
model’s unit has finished making its 
attacks, and is then removed from play.

RELENTLESS ASSAULT
SONS OF SANGUINIUS – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

The Blood Angels are loathe to resort to 
the defensive strategies favoured by 
other Chapters, and a tactical withdrawal 
is but a prelude to re-entering the fray.

WHEN: Your Movement phase, just after 
an Adeptus Astartes unit from your army 
Falls Back.
TARGET: That Adeptus Astartes unit.
EFFECT: Until the end of the turn, your unit 
is eligible to declare a charge even though 
it Fell Back this phase.

BLOOD ANGELS – SONS OF SANGUINIUS
ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Sons of Sanguinius Detachment rule, you can use these Sons of Sanguinius Enhancements.
ARTISAN OF WAR
This warrior is a true artist both on and off the 
battlefield. His talents are reflected in the exquisite 
workmanship of his wargear, for he insists upon 
personally crafting his weapons of war.

ARCHANGEL’S SHARD
When Sanguinius battled Horus, his magnificent 
blade was tragically shattered against the 
Warmaster’s profane battle plate. The shards 
were gathered up and new swords forged to 
incorporate them, each one gifted to a different 
successor Chapter.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Improve the Armour 
Penetration characteristic of the bearer’s weapons by 
1, and the bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.
VISAGE OF DEATH
This exquisitely crafted mask is a thing of dark beauty 
to the Blood Angels, and a sign of impending doom 
to their enemies. The unchanging expression of the 
mask inspires fear and uncertainty even in confident 
enemies. They see no anger, pain or elation on the 
wearer’s face – clues as to the warrior’s state of mind 
in a duel.

Adeptus Astartes model only. While an enemy 
unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) is within 
Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit, halve the 
Objective Control characteristic of models in that unit.

Adeptus Astartes model only. The bearer’s 
melee weapons have the [ANTI-CHAOS 5+] and  
[LANCE] abilities.
ICON OF THE ANGEL
Entrusted to one whose faith in the primogenitor is 
profound, the Icon of the Angel takes the form of a 
small shrine upon the bearer’s backpack. Through 
displaying it, this warrior reminds his brothers of the 
heretics who fled after laying low the Angel, exhorting 
them to let no enemy escape their grasp again.

Adeptus Astartes model only. Each time an enemy 
unit (excluding Monsters and Vehicles) within 
Engagement Range of the bearer’s unit is selected 
to Fall Back, models in that enemy unit must 
take Desperate Escape tests as if their unit was 
Battle-shocked. When doing so, if that enemy unit is 
also Battle-shocked by other means, subtract 1 from 
each of those Desperate Escape tests.

GENESTEALER CULTS
ARMY RULE

Genestealer Cults keep their fighting strength carefully hidden from their oppressors until the glorious Day of 
Ascension arrives. When they finally emerge to fight, it is after long years of meticulous planning, and with an 
intimate knowledge of the battlefield that grants them a tactical advantage. Even as battle rages, reinforcements 
slip from the shadows or spill up from the dark places below, called to war by the Broodmind.

BROOD BROTHERS
Through cunning and unholy good fortune, a 
Genestealer Cult can send its questing tendrils 
writhing into even the highest ranks of the 
military forces that should be standing guard 
against it. So does the Patriarch seize new and 
potent weapons of revolution.

If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, 
you can include Astra Militarum units in 
your army, even though they do not have the 
Genestealer Cults Faction keyword.The 
combined points cost of Astra Militarum units 
you can include in your army depends on your 
battle size, as follows:

 ■ Incursion: Up to 250 pts
 ■ Strike Force: Up to 500 pts
 ■ Onslaught: Up to 750 pts

No Astra Militarum models in your army 
can be your Warlord, and they cannot be 
given Enhancements. You cannot include units 
with any of the following keywords in your 
army using these rules: Epic Hero; Ogryn; 
Ratling; Militarum Tempestus; Commissar; 
Regimental Preacher; Regimental 
Enginseer; Munitorum Servitors; Aircraft. 

CULT AMBUSH
If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, each time 
a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 
3 to the result if it is a Battleline unit. On a 4+, that 
unit is placed into Cult Ambush and you can place 
one Cult Ambush marker* anywhere on the battlefield 
that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy 
units (if this is not possible, no marker is placed).

If an enemy model (excluding Aircraft models) ends 
any kind of move within 9" of a Cult Ambush marker 
you placed, that Cult Ambush marker is removed 
from the battlefield. At the end of the Reinforcements 
step of your opponent’s next Movement phase, for 
each of your Cult Ambush markers that is still on 
the battlefield, you can select one unit from your 
army that is in Cult Ambush and set that destroyed 
unit back up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike 
ability, containing all of its models with their full 
wounds remaining and with at least one of those 
models touching that Cult Ambush marker (that Cult 
Ambush marker is then removed from the battlefield). 

Characters that are attached to a unit with this 
ability are not returned alongside that unit should it 
return to the battlefield as described above (only the 
Bodyguard unit returns).

Designer’s Note: Each time a unit with this ability is 
destroyed, it triggers all rules that apply when a unit 
is destroyed. For example, if a rule awards a player 
1VP each time an enemy unit is destroyed, and a 
unit with this ability is destroyed, returned using this 
ability then subsequently destroyed again, it would 
award the opponent 2VP. 

*  A circular 32mm diameter marker should be used for 
Cult Ambush Markers.

GENESTEALER CULTS – ASCENSION DAY
DETACHMENT RULE

If your Army Faction is Genestealer Cults, you can 
use this Ascension Day Detachment rule.

THEY CAME FROM BELOW
For generations an insidious threat has lain hidden 
within the shadows. Now their time is nigh, and from 
out of the tunnels and sewers they rise to topple 
their oppressors in brutally violent insurrection. 
None can escape the sudden ambushes that herald 
the Day of Ascension! 

Each time a Genestealer Cults unit from 
your army is set up on the battlefield as 
Reinforcements, until the end of your next 
Fight phase, weapons equipped by models 
in that unit have the [SUSTAINED HITS 1] and 
[IGNORES COVER] abilities.

UNQUESTIONING LOYALTY
ASCENSION DAY – EPIC DEED STRATAGEM

Broodkin are so fanatically loyal that they 
do not hesitate to sacrifice themselves to 
protect their leaders.

WHEN: Your opponent’s Shooting phase or 
the Fight phase, just after an enemy unit 
has selected its targets.
TARGET: One Genestealer Cults 
Character unit from your army that was 
selected as the target of one or more of 
that enemy unit’s attacks.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase, each 
time a Character model in your unit

the start of the Fight phase.
TARGET: Two Genestealer Cults units 
from your army that have not been 
selected to shoot or fight this phase, and 
one enemy unit.

TUNNEL CRAWLERS
ASCENSION DAY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Squirming, crawling and scrabbling

to many broodkin, and is a skill they 
use to assail seemingly impregnable 
enemy positions.

WHEN: Your Movement phase.
TARGET: One Genestealer Cults unit 
from your army that is arriving using the 
Deep Strike ability this phase.
EFFECT: Your unit can be set up anywhere 
on the battlefield that is more than 3" 
horizontally away from all enemy models.

Stratagem is not eligible to declare a 
charge in the same turn.

A PERFECT AMBUSH

from your army that arrived from Reserves 
this turn and has not been selected to 
shoot this phase.
EFFECT: Until the end of the phase,

Infantry unit from your army that was 
selected as the target of one or more of

be selected as the target of a ranged 
attack if the attacking model is within 12".

RETURN TO THE SHADOWS
ASCENSION DAY – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM

Ever cunning and duplicitous, broods of 
the faithful often vanish back into tunnels 
and vents after their initial strike, ready to 
regroup and attack again elsewhere.

WHEN: End of your opponent’s turn.
TARGET: Up to two Genestealer Cults 
Battleline units from your army, or one 
other Genestealer Cults Infantry unit 
from your army. 
EFFECT: Remove the targeted units 
from the battlefield and place them into

ENHANCEMENTS

If you are using the Ascension Day Detachment rule, you can use these Ascension Day Enhancements.
PROWLING AGITANT
No matter how often the oppressors seek to trap or 
silence this leader, they always find themselves 
left empty-handed and foolish, their elusive quarry 
long gone.

METICULOUS PLANNER
No other force spends as long laying meticulous 
preparations for the battles to come as the 
Genestealer Cults. Their plans to counter the foe are 
works of dark genius.

Genestealer Cults model only. Once per turn, when 
an enemy unit ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back 
move within 9" of the bearer’s unit, if the bearer’s unit 
is not within Engagement Range of any enemy units, 
it can make a Normal move of up to D6". 
INSCRUTABLE CUNNING
Every variable has been factored into this strategist’s 
master plan. 

Genestealer Cults model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, models in that unit have the Infiltrators 
ability and each time you select that unit as the target 
of a Stratagem, roll one D6: on a 4+, you gain 1CP.

Genestealer Cults model only. Once per battle, just 
after your opponent uses a Stratagem, if the bearer is 
on the battlefield, it can use this ability. If it does, until 
the end of the battle, the CP cost your opponent must 
pay to use that Stratagem again is increased by 1CP.
FOCUS OF ADORATION
This warlord inspires such insane devotion that their 
minions will leap headlong into battle in order to win 
their favour.

Genestealer Cults model only. While the bearer is 
leading a unit, you can target that unit with the Heroic 
Intervention Stratagem for 0CP, and can do so even 
if you have already targeted a different unit with that 
Stratagem this phase.

right, their mastery of insurgent tactics transforms their followers from 
a rebellious mob into a lethal military machine.

Primed and Ready: In your Shooting phase, you can select 
one model from your army with this ability as the target of 
the Grenade Stratagem for 0CP, provided that model has not 
already been the target of that Stratagem this phase. This can 
allow you to use the Grenade Stratagem for a second time 
this phase.
Planted Explosives: Once per battle, when an enemy unit 
ends a Normal, Advance or Fall Back move within 12" of 
this model, this model can use its Reductus mine. If it does, 
roll one D6: on a 2+, that enemy unit suffers D3+3 mortal 
wounds. Only one model from your army with this ability can 
use it in the same battle round.
Designer’s Note: Place a Reductus Mine token next to the 
model, removing it once this ability has been used.

REDUCTUS SABOTEUR
There is no engine of the oppressors that a Reductus Saboteur cannot 
lay low, and few materials they cannot fashion into a bomb given 
a little time to tinker. Flitting through the shadows, they lace the 
battlefield with booby traps and deploy powerful explosives that make 
short work of enemy armour.
